<h3><a name="A1">Spatial Graph</a></h3>
<p>The data type <a class="link" href="../hxspatialgraph/HxSpatialGraph.html#A1">Spatial Graph</a> is used to store data 
 organized in three dimensional networks. <em>Points</em>, <em>Nodes</em>, and 
 <em>Segments</em> are the three basic structural components used in this module. 
 The <em>Nodes</em> are the branching points and endpoints of the network, and 
 the <em>Segments</em> are the lines connecting the nodes. <em>Segments</em>, in turn, 
 consist of <em>Points</em> describing the three-dimensional course of a segment.
 Each <em>Point</em> is identified by spatial coordinates.
 A set of Segments connected by Nodes will be termed a Graph and a SpatialGraph 
 data object can store even several Graphs. 
 One or more scalar data items can be optionally stored for each network item, 
 while labels can be associated only with <em>Nodes</em> and <em>Segments</em>.</p>
<p> In order to store Spatial Grpah sets in an AmiraMesh file, three 1D arrays have to
 be defined, namely <em>EDGES</em>, used to store the Segments indices, <em>VERTEX</em>, used to store the Nodes coordinates, and <em>POINT</em>, for the Points. 
 Scalar values can be attached to Segments, Nodes and Points, while labels and label groups 
 only to Segments and Nodes. Multiple values should be distinguished by denoting 
 them <tt>Data2</tt>, <tt>Data3</tt>, and so on.
 Here is an example with 5 Nodes, 4 Segments and 242 Points, with one label
 (LabelGroup0) associated to the Segments and one scalar (Data0) to the Points:</p>

<p>
 Once the Nodes are defined, the Segments follow using Nodes indices as shown above. 
 For each Segment the number of included Points and their coordinates should be specified. 
 The index of the first item is 0. An index value of -1 indicates that a
 item should be terminated.</p>
