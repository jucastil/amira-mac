<h3><a name="A1">3.2.1 Class Structure</a></h3>
<p>In this section we discuss the object-oriented design of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> in a
little more detail. You already know that data objects, e.g., gray level
image data or vector field sets, appear as separate icons in the <em>Pool</em>. You also know that there are certain display modules
which can be used to visualize the data objects. While some modules
can be connected to many different data objects, e.g., the <em>Bounding
Box</em> module, others cannot, e.g., the <em>OrthoSlice</em> module. The latter
can only be connected to voxel data or to scalar distributions on voxel
grids. The reason is that internally both are represented as a scalar
field with uniform Cartesian coordinates. Consequently, the same
visualization methods can be applied to both. On the other hand, for
example a volumetric tetrahedral grid model of the object of interest
usually looks completely different. But since it is also a 3D data object,
the same <em>Bounding Box</em> module can be connected to it.</p>
<p>In summary, there are <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> data objects that might be conceived of
different type, but with respect to mathematical structure, applicability
of viewing and other processing modules, as well as programming interface
design have many common properties. Obeying principles of object-oriented
design, the data types of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> are organized in class hierarchies where
common properties are attributed to 'higher up' classes and inherited to
'derived' classes, as sub-classes of a class are commonly referred to.
Conceptually each object occurring in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is an instance of a class and
each of its predecessors in the hierarchy that the class belongs to. The
classes and their hierarchies are defined within <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>. As the user you
normally deal with instances of classes only. For instance, there is a
class called "HxObject" with sub-classes "HxData" and "HxModule". "HxData"
comprises the types of data associated with data objects used for modeling
the objects of interest, e.g., volumetric tetrahedral grids or surfaces.
"HxModule" comprises data types that have been assigned to display and
other processing modules, again in accordance with principles of
object-oriented design. This is why <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s data objects and processing
modules are commonly referred to as "objects". </p>
<p>There are also classes in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> that are not derived from "HxObject" and
constitute other data types, and there are several independent class
hierarchies. e.g., there is a class called "HxPort" from which all classes
supporting the operation and display of interface control elements are
derived (see section <a class="link" href="mainwin.html#A4">Properties Area</a> and the
<a class="link" href="HxIndexComponent.html">List of Ports</a> in the index section of the
user's guide). </p>
<p>A single class hierarchy is usually figured as an upside-down tree, i.e.
with the root at the top. Thus the <em>data</em> class tree is the one to
which the information as to which processing module is applicable to which
data object is hooked. Its classes reflect the mathematical structure of
the object models supported by <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>. For example, scalar fields and vector
fields are such structures and derived from a common "field" class which
represents a mapping $$R^3 \rightarrow R^n$$. Deriving a sub-class from this
base class requires a value to be specified for $$n$$.</p>
<p>At the same time fields defined on Cartesian grids are distinguished from
fields defined on tetrahedral grids, i.e., this distinction is part of the
classification scheme that gives rise to branches in the <em>data</em> class
subtree. In the next section of this chapter you will learn more about the
<em>data</em> class hierarchy. In the second section we discuss how some data
types frequently used for various visualization tasks fit into it. </p>
<p>Internally, all class names begin with a prefix <em>Hx</em>. However, you
don't have to remember these names unless you want to use the command
shell to create objects. For example, a bounding box is usually created by
choosing the <em>BoundingBox</em> item from the pop-up menu of a data object
that is to be visualized, but you may also create it by typing <tt>create
HxBoundingBox</tt> in the command window.
