<h2><a name="A1">2.11 Creating animated demonstrations with DemoMaker and DemoDirector</a></h2>
<p>In this tutorial you will learn how to use the
<a class="link" href="../scriptobjects/DemoMaker.html#A1">DemoMaker</a> and <a class="link" href="../hxdemodirector/HxDemoDirector.html#A1">DemoDirector</a>
modules for creating an animated sequence of operations within
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font>. In our example, we will visualize a polygon model using
effects such as transparency, camera rotation, and clipping to make
the visualization more meaningful and attractive. </p>
<p>The tutorial covers the following topics:
</p>
<ul><li>creating an initial network for the demo</li><li>animating an <em>OrthoSlice</em> module</li><li>activating additional modules during the demo</li><li>using a camera rotation or path</li><li>editing or removing events that are already defined</li><li>overlaying a bone model with a transparent skin model</li><li>using clipping to make the skin appear gradually over the bone</li><li>advanced clipping issues</li><li>inserting breaks and defining demo segments</li><li>using function keys for jumping between demo segments</li><li>defining partial loops within the demo sequence</li><li>storing and replaying a demo sequence</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Once you have learned how to define an animated demo sequence, you can
further learn how to record the demonstration into a movie file in
<a class="link" href="tutmovie01.html#A1">Section 2.12</a>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="A2">2.11.1 Creating a Network</a></h3>
<p>First, we need an <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> network that contains all the data and
modules for the visualization and animation we want to do. In our
example, we pick the medical CT scan data set <tt>reg005</tt>. Start by
loading <tt>data/medical/reg005.ctdata.am</tt> from the <tt>AMIRA_ROOT</tt>&nbsp;directory.
By right-clicking on the green data icon and selecting from
the data set's popup menu, attach a <a class="link" href="../hxcore/HxBoundingBox.html#A1">BoundingBox</a>
module as well as an <a class="link" href="../hxlattice/HxOrthoSlice.html#A1">OrthoSlice</a> module to the
data. If you use the mouse to navigate around the model in the 3D
viewer, you should manage to get a result similar to this:
</p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_01.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_01.png" /></a>
 <a href="../../../demo/animation/demodirector_orthoslice.hx">(load network)</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="A3">2.11.2 Animating an OrthoSlice Module</a></h3>
<p>Let us move the <a class="link" href="../hxlattice/HxOrthoSlice.html#A1">OrthoSlice</a> plane up and down
to show what the data looks like. Note that the <em>OrthoSlice</em>
module has a port called <em>Slice Number</em>. If you change the value
of that slider, you see the plane move in the viewer.</p>
<p>Now let us animate this slider using the <a class="link" href="../scriptobjects/DemoMaker.html#A1">DemoMaker</a>
module and <a class="link" href="../hxdemodirector/HxDemoDirector.html#A1">DemoDirector</a> GUI as our first exercise.
Add a <em>DemoMaker</em> module to the pool by right-clicking in the pool and
selecting <em>Create -&gt; Animation/Demo -&gt; DemoMaker</em>. Click on the
<em>DemoDirector</em> button in the console window to
switch to the <a class="link" href="../hxdemodirector/HxDemoDirector.html#A1">DemoDirector</a>.
</p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_demodirector.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_demodirector.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Whenever you want to animate some ports of the current network, you must
add this with the <em>New event ...</em> button in the <em>DemoDirector</em> GUI.
A new window containing all modules in the pool with all their ports opens.
Try to find the entry called <em>OrthoSlice/Slice Number</em>, which corresponds
to the <em>Slice Number</em> port of the current <em>OrthoSlice</em>
module. You can select <em>Slice Number</em> and click <em>Ok</em> or double-click
<em>Slice Number</em> to add it to the <em>DemoDirector</em>. If you cannot find the
entry, you may need to press the <em>Update event list</em> button.
</p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_newEvent.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_newEvent.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Once you have selected <em>OrthoSlice/Slice Number</em>, you see an
<em>OrthoSlice/Slice Number</em> object in the <em>DemoDirector</em>.
If this object is selected you can set the <em>Start/end value</em>
as well as the <em>Start/end time</em>. The start and end value
specify between which two values the OrthoSlice slider will be
moved. The <em>Start/end time</em> can also be changed by moving the
object with the mouse or moving start or end point with the mouse. </p>
<p>Set the <em>start value</em> to <em>0</em> and the <em>end value</em> to <em>30</em>.
Then, set the <em>start time</em> to <em>0</em> and the <em>end time</em> to
<em>15</em>. You have now specified an
<em>event</em> starting at time 0 and ending at time 15, varying the
<em>OrthoSlice</em> slice number between 0 and 30 during that time.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_slicenumber.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_slicenumber.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Test the result by pressing the play button of <em>DemoDirector</em>,
represented by the triangle pointing to the right. When you
press it, the red timeline (representing the current time) will start 
moving from the left to the right. Start and end time of the demo
sequence is represented by blue lines. When the time value is between 0
and 15, you should see that the OrthoSlice plane is moving between
the specified start and end values in the viewer
<a href="../../../demo/animation/demodirector_ortho_demo.hx">(load network)</a>. You
can also play your demo backwards using the play backward button,
represented by a triangle pointing to the left. Or you can move the
timeline with the mouse to go to any point in time of the demonstration.</p>
<p>If the demo sequence runs too slow or too fast, you can adjust this by
clicking on the triangle pointing down and selecting
<em>Configure</em> from the popup menu. Change the <em>Increment</em>
value in the dialog box that appears. A smaller increment will make
the animation slower, whereas a larger increment makes it faster. If
you choose an increment value too large, the animation might become
"jerky".</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="A4">2.11.3 Activating a Module in the Viewer Window</a></h3>
<p>Next, let us add a visualization of the bone structure in the data set
after we have moved the OrthoSlice. Load the data set
<tt>data/medical/reg005.surf</tt> in addition to the current
network. Attach a <a class="link" href="../hxsurftools/HxDisplaySurface.html#A1">SurfaceView</a> module to
it. Click on the yellow <em>SurfaceView</em> module to see its user interface.
Press the <em>Clear</em> button in the <em>Buffer</em> port, then
select <em>Bone</em> and <em>All</em> in the <em>Materials</em> port
and press the <em>Add</em> button in the buffer port. This will
visualize the bone surface of the model. 
</p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_bone.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_bone.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>If you want to switch the bone visualization on and off manually, you
would use the <em>viewer toggle</em> (orange rectangle) of the
<em>SurfaceView</em> module. If you want to include this action in
your demo sequence, you need to do the following:
</p>
<ul><li>Click on the <em>New event ...</em> button in the <em>DemoDirector</em> GUI.</li><li>Select <em>SurfaceView/Viewer Mask/Viewer 0</em> from the list.</li><li>Enter <em>on</em> in the <em>Toggle to value</em> port.</li><li>Enter <em>15</em> in the <em>Trigger time</em> port or move the object
 by mouse to time step 15.</li>
</ul><p> 
</p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_viewertoggle.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_viewertoggle.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>To test the newly added event, first toggle the <em>SurfaceView</em>
module off using its orange viewer toggle icon. Now click the
<em>Jump to start</em> button (triangle pointing to the left together
with a vertical line at its tip) to jump to the start of the
demo sequence. Click the play button. As before, the slice moves
up. When it reaches the maximum value at time 15, the bone model is
switched on (<a href="../../../demo/animation/demodirector_bone_demo.hx">load network</a>).</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="A5">2.11.4 Using a Camera Rotation</a></h3>
<p>To look at the 3D patient model from all sides, let us add a camera
rotation to our demo sequence. Select <em>Create/CameraRotate</em>
from the menu. Try the rotation by using the time slider in the
<em>CameraRotate</em> module. If you do not like the axis of rotation,
reset the time slider to 0, navigate to a good starting view in the
viewer window, and click on <em>recompute</em> in the
<em>CameraRotate</em> module. Note that the values of the 
<em>CameraRotate</em> time slider range from 0 to 360.</p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with the camera rotation, add it to the event
list:
</p>
<ul><li>Click on the <em>New event ...</em> button in the <em>DemoDirector</em> GUI.</li><li>Select <em>CameraRotate / Time</em> from the list.</li><li>Enter <em>0</em> and <em>360</em> as the <em>Start/end value</em>.</li><li>Enter <em>15</em> and <em>30</em> as the <em>Start/end time</em> or position the object at
 this time by mouse interaction.</li>
</ul><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_camrotate.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_camrotate.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Now play the demo to see the result. After moving the slice and
switching on the bone model, the view is rotated so that the bone can
be seen from all sides 
(<a href="../../../demo/animation/demodirector_camrotate.hx">load network</a>).</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="A6">2.11.5 Editing or Removing an Already Defined Event</a></h3>
<p>When you look at the demo sequence so far, you may think that it would
be nice to wait for a short time before rotating the bone model. This
can be done by starting the rotation at a later time step. We can
easily correct this in the <em>DemoMaker</em> module:
</p>
<ul><li>Select the <em>CameraRotate / Time</em> event in the <em>DemoDirector</em>.</li><li>You can change the time in the <em>Start/end time</em> port to <em>20</em> and
 <em>35</em> or move the event to this time with the mouse.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Now you have moved the camera rotation event from 15-30 to 20-35
on the time line. Check the results by playing the demo sequence 
(<a href="../../../demo/animation/demodirector_camrotate2.hx">load network</a>).</p>
<p>Please note that you can delete an event from the sequence by simply
selecting it in the <em>DemoDirector</em> and pressing the delete key or by
right-clicking the event and clicking <em>Remove Event(s)</em>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="A7">2.11.6 Overlaying the Bone with Skin</a></h3>
<p>Now we want to show the patient's outer surface overlayed over the
bone model.
</p>
<ul><li>Attach a second <em>SurfaceView</em> module to the <em>reg005.surf</em> 
 data set. Since <em>Exterior</em> and <em>All</em> are selected as 
 the default materials, this brings up the patient's exterior surface.</li><li>Click on the second <i>SurfaceView</i> module. It should be called 
 <em>SurfaceView2</em>.</li><li>Select <em>transparent</em> from the <em>Draw Style</em> port.</li><li>It will be helpful to show the bone underneath the
 exterior surface, so jump to time step 15 or later in the
 <em>DemoDirector</em> module.</li><li>Adjust the grade of transparency using the <em>BaseTrans</em> 
 slider in <em>SurfaceView2</em>.</li><li>Smooth out the outer surface by clicking on <em>more options</em> 
 in the <em>Draw Style</em> port and selecting <em>Vertex normals</em>.</li><li>Toggle the <em>SurfaceView2</em> module off using its orange viewer toggle icon.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Like we did with the bone model, we can switch on the skin model at
some point in the demo sequence:
</p>
<ul><li>Click on the <em>New event ...</em> button in the <em>DemoDirector</em> GUI.</li><li>Select <em>SurfaceView2/Viewer Mask/Viewer 0</em> from the list.</li><li>Check <em>on</em> in the <em>Toggle to value</em> port.</li><li>Enter <em>35</em> in the <em>Trigger time</em> port.</li>
</ul><p> 
</p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_skin.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_skin.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Again, check out the results by playing the demo sequence.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="A8">2.11.7 Using Clipping to Add the Skin Gradually</a></h3>
<p>Instead of just switching the skin on at one point, we can make it
appear gradually over the bone from bottom to top. In order to do so,
we use the <em>OrthoSlice</em> plane to <em>clip</em> the skin model,
and then move the <em>OrthoSlice</em> plane up.</p>
<p>First, we need to move the <em>OrthoSlice</em> plane down again to where we
want to start the clipping:
</p>
<ul><li>Click on the <em>New event ...</em> button in the <em>DemoDirector</em> GUI.</li><li>Select <em>OrthoSlice/Slice Number</em> from the list.</li><li>Enter <em>30</em> and <em>3</em> as the <em>Start/end values</em>.</li><li>Enter <em>20</em> and <em>35</em> as the <em>Start/end time</em>.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Now, when you play the demo, the <em>OrthoSlice</em> plane will move
down again during the camera rotation
(<a href="../../../demo/animation/demodirector_skin.hx">load network</a>).</p>
<p>Now, we will clip the skin model using the OrthoSlice plane:
</p>
<ul><li>Click on the <em>New event ...</em> button in the <em>DemoDirector</em> GUI.</li><li>Select <em>SurfaceView2 / Clip using OrthoSlice</em> from the list.</li><li>Enter <em>on</em> as <em>Toggle value</em> and <em>35</em> as <em>Trigger 
 time</em>.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_clip.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_clip.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>When you run the animation now, you will not see the skin
surface. This is because it is clipped above the <em>OrthoSlice</em>
plane, and only visible below that plane. To see the partial surface
below the plane, we must make the <em>Orthoslice</em> display
transparent:
</p>
<ul><li>Click on the <em>New event ...</em> button in the <em>DemoDirector</em> GUI.</li><li>Select <em>OrthoSlice / Transparency</em> from the list.</li><li>Select <em>None</em> and <em>Alpha</em> as the <em>from/to values</em>.</li><li>Enter <em>35</em> as the <em>Trigger time</em>.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>This way we have specified that at time 35, the <em>Transparency</em>
port of the <em>OrthoSlice</em> module will be changed from value
<em>None</em> to the new value <em>Alpha</em>. When running the demo 
sequence, the result should look like this:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
<p>
<a href=tutdemodirector_clipresult.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_clipresult.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>As you see, part of the skin model is showing below the transparent
<em>OrthoSlice</em> plane. To show all of the skin, we simply move the
plane upwards pretty much the same way we did before:
</p>
<ul><li>Click on the <em>New event ...</em> button in the <em>DemoDirector</em> GUI.</li><li>Select <em>OrthoSlice / Slice Number</em> from the list.</li><li>Enter <em>3</em> and <em>58</em> as the <em>Start/end value</em>.</li><li>Enter <em>35</em> and <em>50</em> as the <em>Start/end time</em>.</li>
</ul><p> 
</p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_orthoup.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_orthoup.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Now you see the skin slowly appearing over the bone as the clipping
plane moves upwards.</p>
<p>As a last step, you might want to rotate the view again while the skin
is appearing. You can simply reuse the old camera rotation during a second
time range:
</p>
<ul><li>Click on the <em>New event ...</em> button in the <em>DemoDirector</em> GUI.</li><li>Select <em>CameraRotate / Time</em> from the list.</li><li>Enter <em>0</em> and <em>360</em> as the <em>Start/end value</em>.</li><li>Enter <em>35</em> and <em>50</em> as the <em>Start/end time</em>.</li>
</ul><p> 
</p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_camrotclone.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_camrotclone.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>You can check out the final animation by loading a
<a href="../../../demo/animation/demodirector_final.hx">saved network script</a>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="A9">2.11.8 More Comments on Clipping</a></h3>
<p>Clipping can sometimes be a little bit more complicated than in our
example, because clipping can be applied to a plane in two different
orientations. This means that you can either clip away everything
<em>above</em> the plane, or <em>below</em> the plane. Unfortunately
it is not always obvious which of the two cases you are in.</p>
<p>























</p>
<p>However, you can simply invert the orientation of the clipping in the
<em>DemoDirector</em>. In our example, you would simply select
<em>OrthoSlice / Invert clipping orientation</em> from the new event list
and set the time of this event to the very beginning of your demo
sequence (e.g., at some time before the clipping takes effect).
</p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_clipinvert.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_clipinvert.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>You do not need to use an <em>OrthoSlice</em> module to do
clipping. As you have seen, the <em>OrthoSlice</em> might occlude
parts of what you want to show. In that case, it is better to create an
empty <a class="link" href="../hxcore/HxArbitraryCut.html#A1">ClippingPlane</a> module by selecting
<em>Create/Clipping Plane</em> from the menu. Attach the module to
the data set you want to clip (e.g., to <em>reg005.surf</em> in our
example), and then use the <em>ClippingPlane</em> for clipping just as
you used the <em>OrthoSlice</em> before.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="A10">2.11.9 Breaks and Function Keys</a></h3>
<p>The demo sequence that we have created in this tutorial automatically 
runs through the complete time range that we
defined. Sometimes it might be desirable to split the sequence into
several segments, so that the demo will stop at some point and can be
continued whenever the user desires to do so.</p>
<p>To take this into account, you can insert <em>breaks</em>
in the demo sequence. Let us insert one such break
right after the bone model appears: 
</p>
<ul><li>Click on the <em>New event ...</em> button in the <em>DemoDirector</em> GUI.</li><li>Select <em>*Break, continue on keystroke</em> from the event list.</li><li>Enter <em>16</em> as the <em>Trigger time</em>.</li>
</ul><p> 
</p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_break.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_break.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This way the demo will stop at time 16, which is right after the
time when the bone model is switched on (15). When you play the demo
from the start, you will notice that after the bone is switched on,
the demo will stop.</p>
<p>Let us insert a second break at time step 36, which is right before
the skin is starting to show. Proceed as above, using a trigger
time of 36 instead of 16
(<a href="../../../demo/animation/demodirector_final_with_breaks.hx">load network</a>).</p>
<p>If you run the demo from the very beginning, it will stop after the
bone is displayed, and you can read a message in the console window
telling you that <em>DemoMaker</em> just stopped and you may press
<tt>F4</tt> to continue. Try this by pressing the function key
<tt>F4</tt>. The demo continues. </p>
<p>Likewise, the demo will stop just before showing the skin. Again, you
can continue the demo by pressing <tt>F4</tt>. In general, at any
point while the demo is running, you can press the <tt>F3</tt> key to
stop it manually. Pressing <tt>F4</tt> will continue from the
point where the demo stopped.</p>
<p>If you have defined breaks as we did above, there are two more
interesting function keys that in some sense allow you to
<i>navigate</i> through the demo segments: pressing <tt>F9</tt> will
jump back to the previous break or to the very beginning of the demo,
and <tt>F10</tt> will jump to the next break, or to the very end of
the demo. If you use <tt>F9/F10</tt> when the demo is stopped, it will
just jump, and you need to press <tt>F4</tt> to start playing it from
the new time step. If you press <tt>F9/F10</tt> while the demo is
running, it will just jump to the new time step and continue running.</p>
<p>Please note that you can disable the breaks by checking the
<em>skip break</em> toggle in the <em>Options</em> port of the
<em>DemoMaker</em> module. You may even disable the definition of
function keys by checking the <em>options</em> toggle in the
<em>Functions</em> port, and then unchecking <em>function keys</em> in
the second <em>Options</em> port. This is especially important if you
want to use multiple <em>DemoMaker</em> modules, since only one of the
modules can define the keys. 
</p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_moreopt.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_moreopt.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="A11">2.11.10 Loops and Go-to</a></h3>
<p>One more feature that might be required for certain kinds of demos is
the definition of loops. If you just want the whole demo to run in a
loop, you can do this easily using the built-in features of the
<em>DemoDirector</em>: click on the button with the triangle pointing down
and select <em>loop</em> or <em>swing</em>. Now if you play the demo sequence,
it will start over from the beginning (loop mode), or play
forwards, backwards, forwards... (swing mode).</p>
<p>However, you may want to define some part of the demo to run in a
loop, and then stop the loop and continue with the demo upon key
press. You can easily do this with the <em>go-to</em> feature of
<em>DemoDirector</em>: 
</p>
<ul><li>Click on the <em>New event ...</em> button in the <em>DemoDirector</em> GUI.</li><li>Select <em>*Go-to, jump to user-specified time step</em> 
 from the event list.</li><li>Enter <em>14</em> as the <em>Trigger time</em>.</li><li>Enter <em>0</em> as the <em>Time to jump to</em>.</li>
</ul><p> 
</p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_goto.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_goto.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>When you run the demo sequence now, it will loop in the first segment,
only showing the <em>OrthoSlice</em> move up, jump down, move up
again$$\dots$$ You can stop this by clicking on the stop button of the
<em>DemoDirector</em> (<em>Play forward</em> button shows a rectangle while
playing) or by pressing <tt>F3</tt>. To continue
after the loop, you need to jump to the next break (place a break at a
time step after the loop) by pressing <tt>F10</tt>, and then start playing
again by pressing <tt>F4</tt>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="A12">2.11.11 Storing and Replaying the Animation Sequence</a></h3>
<p>As you may have noticed by now, storing a demo sequence once you have
defined it is quite easy: simply save the whole <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> network by
selecting <em>File / Save Network...</em> from the menu. The
<em>DemoMaker</em> module will be saved along with the network and
so will the demo sequence you have defined in the <em>DemoDirector</em>.</p>
<p>When you load the network back into <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>, the state of the network
will be the same as it was when you saved it. This means that you
should be careful to reset the <em>DemoDirector</em> time line to 0
before saving the network, if you want the demo to start from the
beginning.</p>
<p>After loading the network, you can start the demo by clicking on the
play button of the <em>DemoDirector</em>, or by pressing
<tt>F4</tt>. If you want to run the demo automatically right after the
network is loaded, you can use the <em>auto start</em> feature that
you find when you check <em>options</em> in the <em>Functions</em> port:
</p><blockquote>
<p>
 <a href=tutdemodirector_moreopt2.png.html><img width=525 src="tutdemodirector_moreopt2.png" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Just check the <em>auto start</em> toggle and save the network. When
you load it again, the demo will start running automatically
(<a href="../../../demo/animation/demodirector_autorun.hx">load network</a>).
