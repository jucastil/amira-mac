</div><p></p>
<p>
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> can load directly different types of data, including:
</p>
<ul><li>2D and 3D image and volume data</li><li>Geometric models such as point sets, line sets, surfaces, grids</li><li>Numerical simulation data</li><li>Time series and animations</li>
</ul><p>
A large number of file formats are supported in the standard edition or through specific optional readers.
For an introduction to data import, see <a class="link" href="first.html#A1">Chapter 2</a>.
For more details, see <a class="link" href="dataimport.html#A1">section 4.1</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A4">1.2.2 Viewing, navigation, interactivity</a></h3>
<p>All visualization techniques can be arbitrarily combined to produce a single
scene.
Moreover, multiple data sets can be visualized simultaneously, either in
several viewer windows or in a common one.
Thus you can display single or multiple data sets in a single or multiple
viewer windows, and navigate freely around or through those objects.</p>
<p>A built-in spatial <em>transformation editor</em> makes it easy to register data sets with
respect to each other or to deal with different coordinate systems.
Automatic registration of volume or geometric data is also possible.</p>
<p>Direct interaction with the 3D scene allows you to quickly control regions of interest,
slices, probes and more.</p>
<p>Combinations of data sets, representation and processing features can be defined with minimal
user interaction for simple or complex tasks.
See <a class="link" href="overview.html#A1">section 1.1</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A5">1.2.3 Visualization of 3D Image Data</a></h3>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A6">1.2.3.1 Slicing and Clipping</a></h4>
<p>You can quickly explore 3D images looking at single or multiple orthographic or oblique sections.
Multiple data sets can be superimposed on slices, or displayed as height fields.
You can cut away parts of your data to uncover hidden regions.
Curved or cylinder slices are also available.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A7">1.2.3.2 Volume Rendering</a></h4>
<p>One of the most intuitive and most powerful techniques for visualizing
3D image data is <em>direct volume rendering</em>. Light emission and
light absorption parameters are assigned to each point of the
volume. Simulating the transmission of light through the volume makes it
possible to display your data from any view direction without
constructing intermediate polygonal models. By exploiting modern
graphics hardware, <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is able to perform direct volume rendering
in real time, even on very large data when using the <font face="helvetica">Very Large Data Option</font>.
Thus volume rendering can instantly highlight relevant features of your data.
Volume rendered images can be combined with any type of
polygonal display. This improves the usefulness of this technique
significantly. Moreover, multiple data sets can be volume rendered
simultaneously -- a unique feature of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>.
Transfer functions with
different characteristics required for direct volume rendering can
 be either generated automatically or edited interactively using an
intuitive colormap editor.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A8">1.2.3.3 Isosurfaces</a></h4>
<p>Isosurfaces are most commonly used for analyzing arbitrary scalar fields
sampled on discrete grids. Applied to 3D images, the method provides a very
quick, yet sometimes sufficient method for reconstructing polygonal surface
models. Beside standard algorithms, <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> provides an
improved method, which generates significantly fewer
triangles with very little computational overhead. In this way, large 3D data
sets can be displayed interactively even on smaller desktop graphics
computers.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A9">1.2.3.4 Large Volume Data</a></h4>
<p>With the <font face="helvetica">Very Large Data Option</font>, even very large data sets that cannot be fully loaded into memory can be
manipulated interactively. Multi-resolution techniques can manage and visualize
extremely large amounts of volume data of up to hundreds of gigabytes. You can then,
for instance, quickly select a region of interest and extract down-sampled
or partial data for further processing.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A10">1.2.4 Image processing</a></h3>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A11">1.2.4.1 Alignment of image slices</a></h4>
<p>The image <a class="link" href="../hxalign/HxAlignSlices.html#A1">slice aligner</a> enables you to build a consistent stack of images with
manual or automatic tools, if, for instance, physical cross-sections have been shifted during
image acquisition.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A12">1.2.4.2 Image filters</a></h4>
<p>Image features can be enhanced by applying a wide range of filters for controlling contrast, smoothing,
noise reduction and much more.
See <a class="link" href="../hximproc/HxImageEditor.html#A1">Image Filters</a> and <font face="helvetica">Quantification+ Option</font>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A13">1.2.4.3 Image segmentation</a></h4>
<p>Segmentation means assigning labels to image voxels that identify and separate objects in a 3D image.
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> offers a large set of segmentation tools, ranging from
purely manual to fully automatic: brush (painting), lasso (contouring),
magic wand (region growing), thresholding, intelligent scissors, contour fitting
(snakes), contour interpolation and extrapolation, wrapping,
smoothing and de-noising filters, morphological filters for erosion, dilation,
opening and closing operations, connected component analysis, images correlation,
objects separation and filtering (see <font face="helvetica">Quantification+ Option</font>), etc.
See <a class="link" href="tutseg.html#A1">section 2.4</a> for a tutorial about image segmentation.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A14">1.2.5 Model reconstruction</a></h3>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A15">1.2.5.1 Surface generation</a></h4>
<p>Once the interesting features in a 3D image volume have been
segmented, <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is able to create a corresponding polygonal surface
model. The surface may have non-manifold topology if there are
locations where three or more regions join. Even in this case the
polygonal surface model is guaranteed to be topologically correct,
i.e. free of self-intersections. Fractional weights that are
automatically generated during segmentation allow the system to
produce optionally smooth boundary interfaces. This way realistic high-quality
models can be obtained, even if the underlying image data are of low
resolution or contain severe noise artifacts. Making use of innovative
acceleration techniques, surface reconstruction can be performed very
quickly. Moreover, the algorithm is robust and fail-safe.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A16">1.2.5.2 Surface Simplification and Editing</a></h4>
<p>Surface simplification is another prominent feature of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>. It can
be used to reduce the number of triangles in an arbitrary surface
model according to a user-defined value. Thus, models of
finite-element grids, suitable for being processed on low-end
machines, can be generated. The underlying simplification algorithm is
one of the most elaborate ones available. It is able to preserve
topological correctness, i.e., self-intersections commonly produced by
other methods are avoided. In addition, the quality of the resulting
mesh, according to measures common in finite element analysis, can be
controlled. For example, triangles with long edges or triangles with
bad aspect ratio can be suppressed.</p>
<p>A surface editor is also available for smoothing or refining surface
in whole or part, cutting and copying parts of surfaces, defining boundary
conditions for further numerical simulation, checking and modifying surface triangles.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A17">1.2.5.3 Generation of Tetrahedral Grids</a></h4>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> allows you not only to generate surface models from your data
but also to create true volumetric tetrahedral grids suitable for
advanced 3D finite-element simulations. These grids are constructed
using a flexible advancing-front algorithm. Again, special care is
taken to obtain meshes of high quality, i.e., tetrahedra with bad
aspect ratio are avoided.
Several different file formats are
supported, so that the grid can be exported to many standard
simulation packages.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A18">1.2.5.4 Point Clouds/Scattered Data</a></h4>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> can also reconstruct surfaces from scattered points
(see <a class="link" href="../hxgridgen/HxDelaunay2D.html#A1">Delaunay</a> and <a class="link" href="../hxgridgen/HxPointWrap.html#A1">PointWrap</a> modules).</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A19">1.2.5.5 Skeletonization</a></h4>
<p>A set of tools is included for reconstructing and analyzing a dendritic, porous
or fracture network from 3D image data.
</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A20">1.2.6 Visualization of 3D models and numerical data</a></h3>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A21">1.2.6.1 Point sets, line sets</a></h4>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> can visualize arbitrary functional data given on
3D <a class="link" href="../hxcluster/HxCluster.html#A1">point sets</a> or <a class="link" href="../hxlines/HxLineSet.html#A1">line sets</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A22">1.2.6.2 Polygonal models</a></h4>
<p>A number of drawing styles and coloring schemes help to yield meaningful and informative visualizations of
polygonal models, whether generated from image data or imported from CAD or simulation package.
Surface and 3D grid meshes can be colored or textured in order to visualize a second independent data set.</p>
<p>Another <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> feature comprises the realistic view-dependent way of rendering semi-transparent
surfaces. By correlating transparency with local orientation of the surface
relative to the viewing direction, complex spatial structures can be
understood much more easily.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A23">1.2.6.3 Numerical data post-processing</a></h4>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> allows you to analyze results of numerical simulations.
It supports polygonal surfaces such as triangular meshes, 3D lattices with uniform,
rectilinear of curvilinear coordinates, and polyhedral 3D grids such as tetrahedral or hexahedral grids.
Most general purpose image visualization techniques and analysis tools can be applied, e.g.:
slice extraction, computation of isolines or isosurfaces, data probing and histograms.
In addition, scalar quantities can be visualized with pseudo-colors on the grid itself.</p>
<p>Beside visualization, data representations such as isosurfaces, grid cuts or contour lines can
be extracted as first class data objects.</p>
<p>Displacement vectors can be visualized on grids or applied as grid deformation that can be animated.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="A24">1.2.6.4 Flow Visualization</a></h4>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> provides many advanced tools for vector fields and flow visualization.
Vector arrows can be drawn on a slice, within a volume, or upon a surface.
The flow structure may be better revealed by representations such as fast Line Integral Convolution
on slices or arbitrary surfaces, illuminated and animated streamlines,
stream ribbons, stream surfaces, particle animations, synthetic <a class="link" href="../hxvector/HxIcon.html#A1">vector probe</a>, ...
All of these stream visualization techniques are highly interactive.
While seedpoint distributions can be automatically calculated, you can also select and
interactively manipulate seed points and structures,
thus supporting the investigation the flow field and highlighting of different features.
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> can also support six-component complex vector fields and phase visualization, e.g. electromagnetic fields.</p>
<p>See tutorial <a class="link" href="tutvectorAmira.html#A1">section 2.10 (visualization of vector fields)</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A25">1.2.6.5 Tensor Data</a></h4>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> has support for iconic visualization of tensor field, extraction of eigenvalues,
computation of rate of strain tensor, gradient tensor.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="A26">1.2.7 General Data Processing and Data Analysis</a></h3>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A27">1.2.7.1 3D registration of multiple data sets</a></h4>
<p>Multiple data sets can be combined to compare images of different objects, or images of an object
recorded at different times or with different imaging modalities such as X-ray CT and MRI.
In addition, fusion of multi-modal data by arbitrary arithmetic operations can be performed to
increase the amount of information and accuracy in the models.
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> allows manual registration through interactive manipulators, automatic rigid or
non-rigid registration through landmarks, and automatic registration using iterative optimization
algorithms (see <a class="link" href="../hxregistration/HxAffineRegistration.html#A1">AffineRegistration</a> module).</p>
<p>Surfaces can also be registered using rigid or non-rigid transformations, based on landmarks
sets warping, alignment of centers or principal axes, or distance minimization algorithms.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A28">1.2.7.2 Operating on 3D data</a></h4>
<p>Many utilities are available for data processing. Here are some important ones.
Resampling can reduce or enlarge the resolution of a 3D image or data sets defined on regular grids,
and different sampling kernels are supported. Data can be cropped or regions of interest can be defined.
Data can be converted to any supported primitive type, from byte to 64-bits floating point numbers.
Multi-component data such as multi-channel images or vector data can be composed or decomposed.
Standard 3D field operators such as scalar field gradient or vector field curl are available.
Surface curvatures and distances between surfaces can also be computed, as scalar or vector information.
The powerful <a class="link" href="../hxarith/HxArithmetic.html#A1">Arithmetic</a> module allows calculations to be performed on data sets with
user-defined expressions, and can be used to interpolate data between regular grids and polyhedral grids.
Data sets can also be created from arithmetic expressions.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A29">1.2.7.3 Measurements, quantification</a></h4>
<p>You can query the exact values of your data sets at arbitrary locations specified interactively by a
mouse click, or along user-defined lines and spline curves. Probe points can serve to set interactively
isosurfaces.
You can plot or export the data for further processing with spreadsheet or plotting applications,
with probing, measuring, counting, and other statistical modules quantify densities, distances, areas,
volumes, mean value and standard deviation, ...</p>
<p>Histograms of values can be computed and plotted, possibly restricted to a region of interest.
<a class="link" href="../hxtetra/HxCalcVolume.html#A1">Volume/value</a> diagrams can be also plotted.</p>
<p>The <font face="helvetica">Quantification+ Option</font> provides an extensive set of intensity and geometrical measurements on
 image or label data, either for individual labelled particles or as statistics. 
 See the section dedicated to <font face="helvetica">Quantification+ Option</font>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="A30">1.2.8 Matlab integration</a></h3>
<p>You can integrate complex calculus using Matlab software from The Mathworks,
Inc. by means of the <em>CalculusMatlab</em> module.
This module allows for a connection to your Matlab server from your
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> session, and executes Matlab computations directly on your <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> data.
It is also possible to import and export Matlab matrices to and from <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>, and
export <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> surfaces to Matlab surfaces.
See <a class="link" href="tutmatlab.html#A1">section 2.13</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="A31">1.2.9 High Performance Visualization</a></h3>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> makes extensive use of graphics hardware for optimal performance and rendering quality
on your system. Moreover, the <font face="helvetica">Virtual Reality Option</font> allows for combining multiple graphics engines for
high-performance requirements.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A32">1.2.10 Automation, Customization, Extensibility</a></h3>
<p><b>Tcl scripting</b></p>
<p>All <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> components can be controlled via a Tcl command language interface.
Tcl scripts are used for saving your work session. Tcl scripts also allow the advanced user
to automate or customize tasks with <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> for routine workflows, without the need for
C++ programming.
Custom <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> modules with user interface can even be created as Tcl scripts.
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> module behaviour and 3D interaction can be customized by using Tcl.
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> can also be used for batch processing.<br />

See <a class="link" href="scripting.html#A1">Chapter 5</a>, including a short introduction to the Tcl scripting language.</p>
<p><b>C++ programming</b></p>
<p>With the <font face="helvetica">Developer Option</font>, <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> can also be extended by programmers.
The <font face="helvetica">Developer Option</font> allows for the creation of new custom components for <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> such as file readers and writers,
computation modules, and even new visualization modules, using the C++ programming language.
New modules and new data classes can be defined as subclasses of existing ones.
In order to simplify the creation of new custom extensions, a development wizard is included.<br />

See the <font face="helvetica">Developer Option</font> <a class="link" href="../programmersguide/HxDev-intro.html#A1">User's Guide</a> for detailed information.
