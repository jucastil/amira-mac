<h2><a name="A1">4.7 Notes for Mac users</a></h2>
<p>The user will find several important differences when comparing the Mac to the Windows version.
Due to the platform architecture, the Mac version requires specific implementation 
not only for the interface components, but also for the modules functionalities.
Additionally, the tutorials have been developed on Windows platforms.
Therefore, the user has to keep in mind the following issues when reading the examples
of the tutorials and whenever using Amira:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Ctrl Key - The <em>Ctrl key</em> of Windows and Linux corresponds to the <em>Apple/Command</em> key on Mac platforms.</li><li>Stereo - Stereo visualization is not fully supported on Mac, due to Open Inventor compatibilities.
 Only few stereo modes are, therefore, available.</li><li>Main Menu - The main menu on Mac has been redesigned according to the native style. 
 The first item in the main menu is <em>application item</em> "Amira", where 
 application-specific information are available as <em>About Amira</em> or <em>Preferences...</em>.</li><li>Graphic performances - High-end graphic boards are required to use the
 <a class="link" href="../hxvolren/HxVolren.html#A1">Volren</a> module and the editors using this visualization technique. 
 Some iMac and older Mac platforms may not have adequate graphic cards.</li><li>amiraDev - After developing new modules using the amiraDev Package, start Amira normally
 to use or test them. Starting Amira in "debug mode" is not required for Mac platforms. 
 See the amiraDev documentation for details.</li>
</ul><p>
