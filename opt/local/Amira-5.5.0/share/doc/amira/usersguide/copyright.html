The mcla library wrapper library for freely-available LAPACK implementations

From the LAPACK Frequently Asked Questions (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/faq.html):

LAPACK is a freely-available software package. It is available
from netlib via anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web. Thus, it
can be included in commercial software packages (and has
been). We only ask that proper credit be given to the authors.

Like all software, it is copyrighted. It is not trademarked,
but we do ask the following:

If you modify the source for these routines we ask that you
change the name of the routine and comment the changes made to
the original.

We will gladly answer any questions regarding the software. If
a modification is done, however, it is the responsibility of
the person who modified the routine to provide support.

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The sqlite library

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been dedicated to the
public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives
of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating
their contributions to the public domain and originals of those
signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of
Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell,
or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form
or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or
non-commercial, and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code in SQLite
- those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and
ship with a larger application. Portions of the documentation and
some code used as part of the build process might fall under other
licenses. The details here are unclear. We do not worry about the
licensing of the documentation and build code so much because none
of these things are part of the core deliverable SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from
scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the
open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its
original author, and all of those authors have public domain
dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is
uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
 other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for
 your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
 you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide
 complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
 with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
 it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
 the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
 version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
 the original authors' reputations.
     
 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
 software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
 transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this,
 we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
 free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
 GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This
 license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
 designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary
 one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
 the same as in the ordinary license.

The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
 they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
 program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without
 changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
 analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in
 a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
 derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
 treats it as such.

Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
 Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
 sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We
 concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
 users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
 libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to
 permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
 preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
 libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve
 this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
 changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this
 will lead to faster development of free libraries.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
 "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
 former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
 works together with the library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
 General Public License rather than by this special one.
     
     GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
    party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
    General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is
    addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
 included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
 and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 and what the program that uses the Library does.
     
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
    Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 fee.
     
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
    instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
    that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
    these notices.
     
    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
     
 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
 of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
 the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
 distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 distribute.
     
 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
    the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
    rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
     Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
     subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
     restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
     You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
     this License.
     
 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
     conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
     distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
     may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
     license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
     all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
     the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
     refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
     original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
     an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
     so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
     excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
     written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
     but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.
     
 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
     write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
     copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
     Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
     decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
     of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
     EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
     OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
     KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
     IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
     LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
     THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
     AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
     FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
     LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
     RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
     FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
     SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
     DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
     
 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
 ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

&lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
 Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
 modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
 License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
 version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
 Library General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
 License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
 Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990
Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it

Acknowledgments and Other Issues
   
Silicon Graphics has seen fit to allow us to give this work away. 
It is free. There is no support or guarantee of any sort as to its 
operations, correctness, or whatever. If you do anything useful 
with all or parts of it you need to honor the copyright notices. 
It would also be nice to be acknowledged. 

Acknowledgements

The libtiff software was written by Sam Leffler while working for 
Silicon Graphics. The LZW algorithm is derived from the compress 
program (the proper attribution is included in the source code). 
The Group 3 fax stuff originated as code from Jef Poskanzer, but 
has since been rewritten several times. The latest version uses 
an algorithm from Frank Cringle -- consult libtiff/mkg3states.c 
and libtiff/tif_fax3.h for further information. The JPEG support 
was written by Tom Lane and is dependent on the excellent work of 
Tom Lane and the Independent JPEG Group (IJG) who distribute their
work under friendly licensing similar to this software. Many other 
people have by now helped with bug fixes and code; a few of the 
more persistent contributors have been: 

Bjorn P. Brox
Dan McCoy
J.T. Conklin 
Richard Minner
Frank D. Cringle

Warning

It appears that Unisys is actively pursuing copyright control 
on the LZW compression algorithm. In particular, users of the 
LZW compression within the TIFF framework. For this reason the 
TIFF 6.0 spec states that LZW compression is not recommended. 
It is unclear at this time what compression algorithm will be 
used in place of it. I have no idea what this means to you or 
to this library. I make no warranty or guarantees with regard 
to the LZW support in this library.

Why pthreads-win32 did not use the GNU General Public License
-------------------------------------------------------------

    The goal of the pthreads-win32 project has been to
    provide a quality and complete implementation of the POSIX
    threads API for Microsoft Windows within the limits imposed
    by virtue of it being a stand-alone library and not
    linked directly to other POSIX compliant libraries. For
    example, some functions and features, such as those based
    on POSIX signals, are missing.

    Pthreads-win32 is a library, available in several different
    versions depending on supported compilers, and may be used
    as a dynamically linked module or a statically linked set of
    binary modules. It is not an application on it's own.

    It was fully intended that pthreads-win32 be usable with
    commercial software not covered by either the GPL or the LGPL
    licenses. Pthreads-win32 has many contributors to it's
    code base, many of whom have done so because they have
    used the library in commercial or proprietry software
    projects.

    Releasing pthreads-win32 under the LGPL ensures that the
    library can be used widely, while at the same time ensures
    that bug fixes and improvements to the pthreads-win32 code
    itself is returned to benefit all current and future users
    of the library.

    Although pthreads-win32 makes it possible for applications
    that use POSIX threads to be ported to Win32 platforms, the
    broader goal of the project is to encourage the use of open
    standards, and in particular, to make it just a little easier
    for developers writing Win32 applications to consider
    widening the potential market for their products.
