<h1><a name="A1">1 Introduction</a></h1>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is a 3D data visualization, analysis and modelling system. It allows you to
visualize scientific data sets from various application areas, e.g.
medicine, biology, bio-chemistry, microscopy, biomed, bioengineering. 
3D data can be quickly explored, analyzed, compared, and quantified.
3D objects can be represented as image volumes or geometrical surfaces and grids suitable 
for numerical simulations, notably as triangular surface and volumetric tetrahedral grids. 
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> provides methods to generate such grids from voxel data representing an image volume, 
and it includes a general-purpose interactive 3D viewer.</p>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is a powerful, multifaceted software platform for visualizing, manipulating, 
and understanding Life Science and bio-medical data coming from all types of 
sources and modalities. Initially known and widely used as the 3D visualization
tool of choice in microscopy and biomed research, <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> has become a more and 
more sophisticated product, delivering powerful visualization and analysis capabilities 
in all visualization and simulation fields in Life Science.</p>
