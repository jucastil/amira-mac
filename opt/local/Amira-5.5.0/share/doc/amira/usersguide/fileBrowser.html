<h3><a name="A1">3.1.10 File Dialog</a></h3>
<p>The <em>File Dialog</em> is the user interface component for importing and
exporting data into and out of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>. It is used at several places in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>,
most prominently by the <em>Load</em>, <em>Save Data As</em>, and <em>Save
Network</em> items of the main window's <em>File</em> menu.</p>
<p></p><div style="text-align:center"><a name="A2"></a><a href=filedialog.png.html><img width=450 src="filedialog.png" /></a><br />

<font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s file dialog.</div>


</div><p></p>
<p>The dialog provides two modes of information, a detail mode and a 
multi-column mode. In the detail mode, which is active by default,
some file data are shown next to each filename, namely the file size,
the file's last modification time, and the file format.
You may sort the file list according to each of these properties
by clicking on the particular column's header bar.
Subdirectories will always be displayed first. In multi-column mode only
the file name is displayed. You may switch between both modes using the
tool buttons in the upper right part of the dialog window.</p>
<p>Most file formats supported by <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> will be recognized automatically,
either by analyzing the file header or by looking at the file name suffix.
A list of all <a class="link" href="HxIndexFileFormat.html">supported file formats</a> is
contained in the reference section of this manual. You may manually
set the format of a file by means of the dialog's popup menu (see below).</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A3">3.1.10.1 Changing Directories</a></h4>
<p>You can change the current directory by double-clicking a subdirectory in
the file list or by entering a new directory in the dialog's path list. By 
default, the path list contains the current directory, the directory
containing the demo data sets provided with <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>, as well as all directories
defined by the environment variable <tt>AMIRA_DATADIR</tt>. In 
<tt>AMIRA_DATADIR</tt> multiple directory names have to be separated by colons
<tt>[:]</tt> on Unix systems or by semicolons <tt>[;]</tt> on Windows systems.
In addition, on Windows system the names of the twelve most recently
visited directories are stored in the path list.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A4">3.1.10.2 Selecting Files</a></h4>
<p>To select a single file just click on it or type in its name in the file
name text field. </p>
<p>In some cases you might want to select more than one file at once, e.g., when
loading a 3D image data set as a series of single 2D images. You can do
this by selecting the first file first and then shift-selecting the last
file. Then all intermediate files will be selected as well. Moreover, you
may ctrl-click a file in order to toggle its selection state individually.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A5">3.1.10.3 The File Dialog's Popup Menu</a></h4>
<p>The file dialog provides a popup menu which may be activated by pressing
the right mouse button over the file list. Among others, this menu lets
you rename or delete files or directories, provided you have the
permission to do that. Note that you may only delete empty directories.</p>
<p>Using the <em>Format</em> option of the popup menu you may manually set the
format to be used when loading a file into <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>. This option is useful
if for some reason the wrong format has been detected automatically, or
if no format at all could be detected. Note however, that any format
specification set manually will be overwritten when the directory is
reread the next time.
