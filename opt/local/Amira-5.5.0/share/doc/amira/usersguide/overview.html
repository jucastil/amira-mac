<h2><a name="A1">1.1 Overview</a></h2>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is a modular and object-oriented software system. Its basic system
components are modules and data objects. Modules are used to visualize data
objects or to perform some computational operations on them. The components
are represented by little icons in the <em>Pool</em>. Icons are
connected by lines indicating processing dependencies between the components,
i.e., which modules are to be applied to which data objects. 
Alternatively, modules and data objects can be displayed in a <em>tree view Explorer</em>. 
Modules from data objects of specific types are created automatically from file input data when
reading or as output of module computations. Modules matching an
existing data object are created as instances of particular module types 
via a context-sensitive popup menu. Networks can be created with a minimal 
amount of user interaction. Parameters of data objects and modules can
be modified in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s interaction area.</p>
<p>For some data objects such as surfaces or colormaps there exist
special-purpose interactive editors that allow the user to modify the
objects. All <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> components can be controlled via a Tcl command
interface. Commands can be read from a script file or issued manually in a
separate console window.</p>
<p>The biggest part of the screen is occupied by a 3D graphics window.
Additional 3D views can be created if necessary. In total, there are
more than 270 data object and module types. They allow the system to
be used for a broad range of applications. Scripting can be used for
customization and automation. User-defined extensions are facilitated
by the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> developer version.</p>
