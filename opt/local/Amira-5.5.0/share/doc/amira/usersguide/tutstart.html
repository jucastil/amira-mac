<h2><a name="A1">2.1 Getting Started</a></h2>
<p>In this section you will learn how to </p>
<p></p>
<ol><li>start the program</li><li>load a demo data set into the system</li><li>invoke editors for editing the data</li><li>connect visualization modules to the data</li><li>interact with the 3D viewer.</li>
</ol><p></p>
<p>The following text has the form of a short step-by-step tutorial. Each step
builds on the steps described before. We recommend that you read the text online
and carry out the instructions directly on the computer. Instructions
are indicated by a dot so you can execute them quickly without reading the
explanations between the instructions.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Windows, select the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> icon from the start menu.</li><li>Mac, select the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> icon from the Application menu.</li><li>Unix-Linux, start <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> by entering <tt><font face="helvetica">Amira</font></tt> in a shell
 window.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>If there is no such command, the software has not been properly installed.
In this case try to execute the script <tt>bin/start</tt> located in the <tt>AMIRA_ROOT</tt> &nbsp;directory.</p>
<p>When <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is running, a window like the one shown in Figure
<a class="link" href="#A3">2</a> appears on the screen. The user interface is
divided into four major regions. The 3D viewer window displays
visualization results, e.g., slices or isosurfaces. The Pool
will contain small icons representing data objects and modules. The
Properties Area displays interface elements (<em>ports</em>) associated
with <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> objects. Finally, the lower right pane is shared by
the console and the DemoDirector timeline. 
Click on the Console or DemoDirector tab to select which window you want to view.
The console prints system messages and lets you enter <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> commands.
The DemoDirector allows you to create animations.</p>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s integrated help browser can be activated by pressing
F1, selecting <em>User's Guide</em> from the <em>Help</em> menu of
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s main window, or by typing <tt>help</tt> in the console
window.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A2">2.1.1 Loading Data</a></h3>
<p></p><div style="text-align:center"><a name="A3"></a><a href=getstart_gui1.png.html><img width=750 src="getstart_gui1.png" /></a><br />
<div class="caption">
<b>Figure 2:</b>
The <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> user interface consists of six major parts: 
 the 3D viewer (1), the Pool (2), the Properties Area (3), the
 console window (4), the DemoDirector (5), and the help browser (6).</div>


</div><p></p>
<p>
Usually, the first thing you will do after starting <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is to load a
data set. Let's see how this can be done:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Choose <em>Open Data ...</em> from the <em>File</em> menu.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>After selecting this menu item, the file dialog appears (see Figure
<a class="link" href="#A4">3</a>). By default the dialog displays the contents of 
the first directory defined in the environment variable <tt>AMIRA_DATADIR</tt>.
If no such variable exists the contents of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s demo data directory
are displayed. You can quickly switch to other directories, e.g., to the
current working directory, using the directory list located in the upper
part of the dialog window. </p>
<p>At the top of the Pool is an Open Data button which is a shortcut
to the File/Open Data dialog. You may use it for opening data files in the 
tutorials that follow. However, the tutorials will instruct you to use 
the File/Open Data command.</p>
<p></p><div style="text-align:center"><a name="A4"></a><a href=getstart_gui5.png.html><img width=450 src="getstart_gui5.png" /></a><br />
<div class="caption">
<b>Figure 3:</b>
Data sets can be loaded into <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> using the file browser. In
 most cases, the file format can be determined automatically. This is
 done by either analyzing the file header or the file name suffix.
 </div>


</div><p></p>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is able to determine many file formats automatically, either by
analyzing the file header or the file name suffix. The format of a
particular file will be printed in the file dialog right beside the
file name.</p>
<p>Now, we would like to load a scalar field from one of the demo data
directories contained in the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> distribution.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Change to the directory <tt>data/tutorials</tt>, select the
 file <tt>lobus.am</tt> and press <em>Load</em>.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>The data will be loaded into the system. Depending on its size this may
take a few seconds. The file is stored in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s native <em>AmiraMesh</em>
format. The file <tt>lobus.am</tt> contains 3D image data of a part of a
fruit fly's brain, namely an optical lobe, obtained by confocal
microscopy. This means the data represents a series of parallel 2D image
slices across a 3D volume. Once it has been loaded, the data set appears as
a green icon in the Pool. In the following we call this data
set "lobus data set". </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Click on the green data icon with the left mouse button to select it.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p></p><div style="text-align:center"><a name="A5"></a><a href=getstart_gui6.png.html><img width=450 src="getstart_gui6.png" /></a><br />
<div class="caption">
<b>Figure 4:</b>
Data objects are represented by green icons in the 
 Pool. Once an icon has been selected information about the data
 set such as its size or its coordinate type is displayed in the
 Properties Area.</div>
 
</div><p></p>
<p>This causes some information about the data record to be displayed in the
Properties Area (Figure <a class="link" href="#A5">4</a>). In our case we can read off the
dimensions of the data set, the primitive data type, the coordinate type,
as well as the voxel size. To deselect the icon, click on an empty area in
the Pool window. You may also pick the icon with the left mouse
button and drag it around in the Pool.</p>
<p>Clicking on an object typically causes additional buttons to be displayed in the
button area at the top of the Pool. These buttons are convenience
buttons allowing easy one-click access to the modules most frequently used
with the selected object. The tutorials, however, will have you access
modules via the menu interface to help familiarize you with the organization 
of modules within <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A6">2.1.2 Invoking Editors</a></h3>
<p>After selecting an object, in addition to the textual information,
some buttons appear in the Properties Area, to the far right of the data
object's name. These buttons represent <em>editors</em>, which
can be used to interactively manipulate the data object in some
way. For example, all data objects provide a <em>parameter
editor</em>. This editor can be used to edit arbitrary attributes
associated with the data set, e.g., filename, original size, or
bounding box. Another example is the <em>transform editor</em>
which can be used to translate or rotate the data in world
coordinates. However, at this point we don't want to go into
details. We just want to learn how to invoke and close an editor:</p>
<p></p><div style="text-align:center"><p>
 <a href=getstart_gui8.png.html><img width=450 src="getstart_gui8.png" /></a>
</p></div><p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Invoke one of the editors by clicking on an editor icon.</li><li>Close the editor by clicking again on the editor icon.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Further information about particular editors is provided in the user's
reference manual.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A7">2.1.3 Visualizing Data</a></h3>
<p>Data objects like the lobus data can be visualized by attaching <em>display modules</em> to them. Each icon in the Pool provides a popup
menu from which compatible modules, i.e., modules that can operate on
this specific kind of data, can be selected. To activate the popup menu</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>click with the right mouse button on the green data icon. 
 Choose the entry called <em>BoundingBox</em>.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p></p><div style="text-align:center"><a name="A8"></a><a href=getstart_gui7.png.html><img width=450 src="getstart_gui7.png" /></a><br />
<div class="caption">
<b>Figure 5:</b>
In order to attach a module to a data set, click on the green icon
 using the right mouse button. A popup menu appears containing all
 modules that can be used to process this particular type of
 data.</div>


</div><p></p>
<p>After you release the mouse button, a new <em>BoundingBox</em> module is
created and is automatically connected to the data object. The <em>Bounding Box</em> object is represented by a yellow icon in the 
Pool and the connection is indicated by a blue line connecting the
icons. At the same time, the graphics output generated by the <em>BoundingBox</em> module becomes visible in the 3D viewer. Since the output
is not very interesting, in this case we will connect a second display
module to the data set:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Choose the entry called <em>OrthoSlice</em> from the popup menu of the 
 lobus data set.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Now a 2D slice through the optical lobe is shown in the viewer window.
Initially, a slice oriented perpendicular to the z-direction and centered
inside the image volume is displayed. Slices are numbered 0, 1, 2, and so
on. The slice number as well as the orientation are parameters of the <em>OrthoSlice</em> module. In order to change these parameters, you must select
the module. As for the green data icon, this is done by clicking on the
<em>OrthoSlice</em> icon with the left mouse button. By the way, in contrast
to the <em>BoundingBox</em>, the <em>OrthoSlice</em> icon is orange, indicating
that this module can be used for clipping.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Select the <em>OrthoSlice</em> module.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Now you should see various buttons and sliders in the Properties Area,
ordered in rows. Each row represents a <em>port</em> allowing you
to adjust one particular control parameter. Usually, the name of a port is
printed at the beginning of a row. For example, the port labeled <em>Slice Number</em> allows you to change the slice number via a slider.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Select different slices using the <em>Slice Number</em> port.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>By default, <em>OrthoSlice</em> displays slices with axial orientation, i.e.,
perpendicular to the z-direction. However, the module can also extract
slices from the image volume perpendicular to x- and y-direction. These
two alternate orientations are sometimes referred to as <em>sagittal</em> and <em>coronal</em> (these are standard phrases used in radiology).</p>
<p></p><div style="text-align:center"><a name="A9"></a><a href=getstart_gui2.png.html><img width=450 src="getstart_gui2.png" /></a><br />
<div class="caption">
<b>Figure 6:</b>
Visualization results are displayed in the 3D viewer window.
 Parameters or ports of a module are displayed in the Properties Area after
 you select the module.</div>


</div><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A10">2.1.4 Interaction with the Viewer</a></h3>
<p>The 3D viewer lets you look at the model from different positions. If
you click on the <em>Trackball</em> button in the viewer toolbar, moving the 
mouse inside the viewer window with the left mouse button pressed
lets you rotate the object. If you click on the <em>Translate</em> or the <em>Zoom</em> 
buttons, you can translate or zoom the object. (For zoom, move the
mouse up and down.)</p>
<p>Alternatively, with the middle mouse button pressed you can translate
the object. For zooming press both the left and the middle mouse buttons at
the same time and move the mouse up or down. </p>
<p>Notice that the mouse cursor has the shape of a little hand inside the
viewer window. This indicates that the viewer is in viewing mode. By pressing
the <tt>ESC</tt> key you can switch the viewer into interaction mode. In this
mode, interaction with the geometry displayed in the viewer is possible by
mouse operations. For example, when using <em>OrthoSlice</em> you can change
the slice number by clicking on the slice and dragging it.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Select different buttons of the <em>Orientation</em> port of the 
 <em>OrthoSlice</em> module.</li><li>Rotate the object in a more general position.</li><li>Disable the <em>adjust view</em> toggle in the <em>Options</em> port.</li><li>Change the orientation using the <em>Orientation</em> port again.</li><li>Choose different slices using the <em>Slice Number</em> port or 
 directly in the viewer with the interaction mode described above.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p></p><div style="text-align:center"><a name="A11"></a><a href=getstart_gui3.png.html><img width=450 src="getstart_gui3.png" /></a><br />
<div class="caption">
<b>Figure 7:</b>
The <em>OrthoSlice</em> module is able to extract arbitrary 
 orthogonal slices from a regular 3D scalar field or image volume.
 </div>


</div><p></p>
<p>Each display module has a <em>viewer toggle</em> by which you can switch off
the display without removing the module. This button is just to the right
of the colored bar where the module name is shown as illustrated below.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Deactivate and activate the display of the <em>OrthoSlice</em> or 
 <em>BoundingBox</em> module using the <em>viewer toggle</em>.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p></p><div style="text-align:center"><p>
 <a href=getstart_gui4.png.html><img width=450 src="getstart_gui4.png" /></a>
</p></div><p></p>
<p>If you want to remove an object from the Pool, select it and choose <em>Remove Object</em> from the <em>Pool</em> menu. Choose <em>Remove All</em> from the same menu
to remove all objects. 
</p>
<ul><li>Remove the <em>BoundingBox</em> module by selecting its icon and 
 choosing <em>Remove Object</em> from the <em>Pool</em> menu.</li><li>Remove all remaining objects by choosing <em>Remove All Objects</em> from the
 same menu.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Now the Pool should be empty again. You may continue with the next
tutorial, i.e., the one on <a class="link" href="tutscalar.html#A1">scalar field visualization</a>.
