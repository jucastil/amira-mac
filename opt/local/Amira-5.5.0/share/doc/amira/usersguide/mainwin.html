<h3><a name="A1">3.1.7 Main Window</a></h3>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s Main window consists of two components: the
<a class="link" href="subapp.html#A1">sub-application</a> <em><a class="link" href="#A2">Pool</a></em> in
the upper part of the window, and the <em><a class="link" href="#A4">Properties Area</a></em> in the lower part.</p>
<p>The Pool contains icons representing data objects and modules
currently in use as well as lines connecting icons indicating dependencies
between objects and modules. </p>
<p>"Pool" will be used throughout the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> documentation
to refer generically to the upper pane of the main <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> window containing 
the collection of objects and modules that define the visualization network.</p>
<p>The Properties Area is the place where the user
interface of selected objects is displayed. Typically, the interface
consists of buttons and sliders arranged in <em>Ports</em>. They
can be thought of as ports because the user can pass information to a
module through them. The Pool and the Properties Area are described below.</p>
<p>By default, the Main Window, the <a class="link" href="viewer.html#A1">Viewer window</a>, 
the <a class="link" href="console.html#A1">Console window</a>, and the
<a class="link" href="onlinehelp.html#A1">Help browser</a> are all panes of a single large <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> window. 
However, it is possible
to designate that any of these last three components be displayed in its own
top-level window using the <em><a class="link" href="preferences.html#A3">Layout</a></em> tab of the 
<em><a class="link" href="preferences.html#A1">Edit/Preferences</a></em> menu.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A2">3.1.7.1 Pool (Object Pool)</a></h4>
<p><b>Concepts</b>
<br />

The Pool is displayed if "object pool" is selected. This selection is made 
using the <em><a class="link" href="preferences.html#A3">Layout</a></em> tab of the <em><a class="link" href="preferences.html#A1">Edit/Preferences</a></em> menu.</p>
<p>Once a data object has been loaded or a module has been created, it will be
represented by an icon in the Pool. Some objects, especially
initially loaded colormaps, may not be visible here. Such hidden objects are listed in the
<em>Pool/Show Object</em> menu of the Main Window. Selecting an object from this
menu causes the corresponding icon to be made visible in the Pool. </p>
<p>Icon colors are used to indicate different types of objects. Data objects are shown in
green and are the only objects which can be saved to disk using <em>File/Save</em>.
Computational modules are shown in red, visualization modules are yellow, and
visualization modules of <em>slicing</em> type are orange. Such
modules may be used to clip the graphical output of any other module.</p>
<p>Connections between data objects and processing modules, shown as blue
lines, represent the flow of data. For display modules, these connections
show the data used to generate the display. You may connect or disconnect objects
by picking and dragging a blue line between object icons. </p>
<p>As you might expect, not all types of processing modules are applicable
to all kinds of data objects. If you click on a data object icon with the right
mouse button, a menu pops up that shows all types of modules that can
be connected to that object. (Alternatively, you can click on the 
small white triangle on the right side of the icon with the
left, right, or middle button.) Selecting one of the modules will automatically
create an instance of that module type and connect it to the data object.
A new icon and a connecting line will appear in response. This way you
can set up a more or less complex network that represents the computational
steps required to carry out a specific visualization task and is used 
to trigger them. Note that modules used will appear as shortcut (or
macro) buttons in the upper part of the window.</p>
<p>If you look closer at an object's icon you will notice two small squares on
its left, one white and one orange. If you click on the white square with 
the left (or right, or middle) mouse button, a menu pops up that shows all connection 
ports of that object. </p>
<p>If the white square has a "-" or a "+" inside, you can click it with the 
left (or right, or middle) mouse button to hide ("collapse") or unhide 
the objects connected to that 
object. The collapse feature is helpful if there are too many 
objects in the Pool to view easily at once. The hidden objects will be visible
in the <em>Pool/Show Object</em> menu.</p>
<p>The orange square controls the object's visibility in the viewers. 
It shows the current viewer layout (1 viewer, 2 viewers, etc.). Click
inside the region of the square corresponding to a specific viewer 
to toggle the visibility of the object in that viewer. The region turns 
gray when the module is set to invisible. If you are using more than 
4 viewers, each additional viewer will have its own orange square on
the object's icon. You can also control an object's visibility by clicking 
on its visibility toggle in the Properties Area.</p>

<div class="caption">

The Pool contains data objects and module icons.</div>


</div><p></p>
<p>As mentioned above, for
most objects the required connections are automatically established on
creation. However, in order to set up optional connections you must use
the connection popup menu. For example, you may attach an optional scalar
field to an Isosurface module's Colorfield port in order to color the 
surface using the values in the Colorfield.</p>
<p>Once you have selected an entry from the connection popup menu of the
object icon, you can
choose a new input object for that port. In order to do so, click on the
input object's icon in the Pool. The blue connection line will
become lighter blue if the connection port can be connected to the chosen
object. Reasons for not being able to connect an input to a port can include
the following: incompatible data type (use Castfield to change), 
incompatible dimensionality of the input (use ChannelWorks to change), incompatible
grid type of the data (for example, use Arithmetic to sample on a regular grid), or simply
that the connection does not make sense, for example, connecting a display
module for surfaces to a CT data set.</p>
<p>In order to disconnect an input object click on the icon of the
module the port belongs to. Data objects possess a special connection port
called <em>Master</em>. This port refers to a computational module or editor
the data object is attached to. It indicates that the computational module
or editor controls the data object, i.e., that it may modify its contents. </p>
<p>Each object has an associated control panel containing buttons and sliders
for setting or changing additional parameters of the object. The control
panel becomes visible once the object has been selected, i.e. by clicking
on its icon with the left mouse button. In order to select multiple objects,
you can shift-click the corresponding icons or select them by using the
rectangular selection tool (press and hold down the left mouse button over the
Pool background, then sweep out a rectangle). Clicking on the icon of a
selected object deselects it again. Clicking somewhere on the background
of the Pool causes all selected objects to be deselected. One or more 
selected icons
may be dragged around in the Pool by clicking on them and moving the
mouse pointer while holding down the mouse button.<br />
</p>
<p><b>Interface</b>
<br />

At the right of the Pool banner are the <em>PoolSelect</em> (arrow)
and <em>PoolPan</em> (hand) buttons. In PoolSelect mode, the mouse is used
for selecting, positioning, connecting, and disconnecting objects in 
the Pool. In PoolPan mode, moving the mouse pans the 
Pool workspace. Press the Control key to switch temporarily
from one mode to the other.</p>
<p>At the top of the Pool is a region containing shortcut (or macro) 
buttons. The <em>Open Data</em> button is a shortcut to the <em>File/Open Data</em>
menu item. Up to 4 additional buttons are automatically displayed depending
on the currently selected object(s). They provide easy access to the 
modules that are most commonly used and/or that have been recently used 
with the currently selected object.</p>
<p>The trashcan at the bottom right of the Pool provides a convenient
shortcut for removing an object. Drag the object to the trashcan. When the cursor
turns into an "X", release the mouse button and the object will be
removed from the Pool. If you remove a data object, all modules
downstream from that module will be deleted as well. Alternatively, you can use
the <em>Remove object</em> item from the <em>Pool</em> menu, or you can use
the Delete key or Ctrl-x to remove a selected object.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="A4">3.1.7.2 Properties Area</a></h4>
<p>Once an object has been selected, its input controls will be displayed
in the Properties Area below the Pool. </p>
<p>
</p><div style="text-align:center"><a name="A5"></a><a href=properties_area.png.html><img width=450 src="properties_area.png" /></a><br />
<div class="caption">
<b>Figure 43:</b>
The Properties Area contains the input controls for 
 objects in the Pool. This is the "control panel" for the Arithmetic module.</div>


</div><p></p>
<p>Each object has a specific
set of controllable parameters or options. These are described in
detail for each module in the <a class="link" href="HxIndexModule.html">index
section</a> of the reference manual. Computational modules and
visualization modules also provide a question mark button which lets
you access the documentation of that module directly.</p>
<p>The <em>Apply</em> button is active (green) for modules that require
you to explicitly initiate their action. Typically this
is the case for modules whose action may take a significant
amount of time, such as some of the compute modules. 
When the <em>Stop</em> button is red, you can press it to interrupt the action.</p>
<p>Check on the <em>auto-refresh</em> check box to automatically force an
apply for any change in the network.</p>
<p>At the top of an object's control panel its name is displayed and a number
of additional control buttons are provided. All data objects and display modules
have one or more orange viewer buttons for each 3D viewer. These buttons control
whether any graphical output of an object is displayed in a particular
viewer or not. For example, if you have two viewers and two isosurface
modules you may want to display one isosurface in each viewer.</p>
<p>Display modules of <em>slicing</em> type (orange ones) provide a clip button.
Clicking this button will cause the graphical output of any other module to
be clipped by that slice. Clipping does not affect modules with hidden
geometry or modules that are created after the clip button has been
pressed.</p>
<p>Data objects provide a number of additional <em>editor</em> buttons. Editors
are used in order to modify the contents of a data object interactively.
For example, you can perform manual segmentation of 3D image data by
editing <a class="link" href="../hxfield/HxUniformLabelField3.html#A1">label fields</a> using the
<a class="link" href="../hxsegeditor/GI.html#A1">image segmentation editor</a>. Some editors display their controls
in the Properties Area like all other objects, while others use a separate dialog
window that allows you to perform object manipulations.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, specific input controls of an object or a module are
organized in <em>Ports</em>. Each port has a pin button on its
left. If a port is pinned it will still be visible even when the object is
deselected. The ports are composed of various widgets that reflect an
operational meaning, e.g., a value is entered by a slider, a state is set by
radio buttons, a binary choice is presented as a toggle button. The control
elements have a uniform layout and are divided into several basic types. A
description of the basic port types is contained in the
<a class="link" href="HxIndexComponent.html">component index</a> section of the User's Reference 
Manual. <br />
</p>
<p>Ports whose labels are displayed in italic are special: they are input connection 
ports. They are used for connecting data objects and
modules into a network that represents the computational steps required to 
carry out a specific visualization task. Each connection port contains the list
of objects to which it can be possibly connected, plus a "NO SOURCE" item, which
means not to connect to anything. </p>
<p>In object pool mode, display of these 
connection ports can be toggled on and off via the <em><a class="link" href="preferences.html#A3">Layout</a></em> tab of 
the <em><a class="link" href="preferences.html#A1">Edit/Preferences</a></em> menu. They
are displayed by default to help beginners understanding the Pool architecture.</p>
