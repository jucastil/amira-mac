<h3><a name="A1">3.1.3 Pool Menu</a></h3>
<p>The <em>Pool</em> menu provides control over the visibility of object icons
and lets you delete or duplicate objects. Depending on how many icons are
selected in the Pool, some menu options might be disabled.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A2">3.1.3.1 Hide Object</a></h4>
<p>The <em>Hide Object</em> button hides all currently selected objects. The object's
icons are removed from the Pool but the objects themselves are
retained. You get the same effect by pressing the <tt>Ctrl-H</tt> key. Hidden
objects can be made visible again using <em>Show Object</em> or <em>Show All Objects</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A3">3.1.3.2 Remove Object</a></h4>
<p>The <em>Remove Object</em> button deletes all selected objects and removes the
corresponding icons from the Pool. You can get the same effect by
pressing the <tt>Delete</tt> key or <tt>Ctrl-X</tt>. If you want to reuse a data object later on, be sure
to save it in a file before deleting it. If a data object has been modified
but has not yet been saved to a file, it is marked by a little asterisk in
the object icon. In the Preferences dialog you can choose whether a warning
dialog should be printed if you try to delete unsaved data objects that
cannot be recomputed by an up-stream compute module. If you delete a data
object, all connected modules will be deleted as well. However, if you
delete a module, connected data objects (e.g., the results of a compute
module) will be retained.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A4">3.1.3.3 Duplicate Object</a></h4>
<p>The <em>Duplicate Object</em> button creates copies of all selected data objects.
For each copy a new data icon is put in the Pool. The name of a
duplicated data object differs from the original name by one or more
appended digits. The duplicate option is not available if you have selected
icons that do not represent data objects (e.g., display or compute
modules).</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A5">3.1.3.4 Rename Object</a></h4>
<p>This button allows you to change the name of a selected object in a small
dialog box which pops up when the button is pressed. If no object
is selected the button is disabled and if multiple objects are selected only
the first selected object will be renamed.
Note that no two objects in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> can have the same name. Therefore,
Amira may modify the name entered in the dialog by appending digits to it.
The dialog can also be raised by pressing the <tt>F2</tt> key after an object
in the pool has been selected.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A6">3.1.3.5 Show Object</a></h4>
<p>The <em>Show</em> button allows you to make hidden objects visible, so that
their icons are displayed in the Pool. Among the hidden objects
there are usually some colormaps that were loaded at start-up. This option
will be unavailable if there are no hidden objects.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A7">3.1.3.6 Show All Objects</a></h4>
<p>The <em>Show All</em> button makes all currently hidden objects visible, so
that their icons are displayed in the Pool. This option will be
unavailable if there are no hidden objects.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A8">3.1.3.7 Remove All Objects</a></h4>
<p>The <em>Remove All Objects</em> button deletes all removable icons and the
associated objects from the Pool. Some objects such as colormaps remain in the pool.
If you select the option <i>check if data objects need to be saved</i> in
the Preferences dialog, a warning dialog is popped up if there are data
objects which have not yet been saved to a file.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A9">3.1.3.8 Make All Display Modules Pickable</a></h4>
<p>This button makes all display modules in the pool pickable. A display module is
pickable if the associated 3D object can be picked.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A10">3.1.3.9 Make All Display Modules Unpickable</a></h4>
<p>This button makes all display modules in the pool unpickable. None of
the 3D objects associated with the display modules in the pool can be
picked.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A11">3.1.3.10 Duplicate mode</a></h4>
<p>This mode is applicable when multiple modules of the same type
will be attached to a single data object. If the toggle is on, the port 
values of the first module will be used to initialize the port 
values of subsequently attached modules. This can be
convenient if you want the modules to have the same initial 
port values.</p>
<p>Example: Attach an Orthoslice to your data object and set the
Mapping type to "Colormap" and the colormap range to 0-3. If you
attach another Orthoslice to the same data object, its Mapping
type will be "Colormap" and its colormap range will be 0-3.</p>
