<h3><a name="A1">3.2.2 Scalar Field and Vector Fields</a></h3>
<p>The most important fields in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> are three-dimensional ones. These fields
are defined on a certain domain $$\subseteq {\mathrm R}^3$$. A field can be
evaluated at any point inside its domain. If the field is defined on a
discrete grid, this usually involves some kind of interpolation.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A2">3.2.2.1 Scalar Fields</a></h4>
<p>A 3D scalar field is a mapping $$R^3 \rightarrow R$$. The base class of all
3D scalar fields in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is <em>HxScalarField3</em>. Various sub-classes
represent different ways of defining a scalar field. There are a number of
visualization methods for them, for example pseudo-coloring on cutting
planes, iso-surfacing, or volume rendering. However, many visualization
modules in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> rely on a special field representation. Therefore, they
can only operate on sub-classes of a general scalar field. Whenever a
given geometry is to be pseudo-colored, any kind of scalar field can be
used (cf. <a class="link" href="../hxlattice/HxColorwash.html#A1">Colorwash</a>, <a class="link" href="../hxtetra/HxGridVolume.html#A1">GridVolume</a>,
<a class="link" href="../hxiso/HxIsosurface.html#A1">Isosurface</a>).</p>
<p>The class <em>HxTetraScalarField3</em> represents a field which is defined on
a tetrahedral grid. On each grid vertex a scalar value, e.g., a temperature,
is defined. Values associated to points inside a tetrahedron are obtained
from the four vertex values by linear interpolation. This class does not
provide a copy of the grid itself, instead a reference to the grid is
provided. This is indicated in the Pool by a line which connects 
the grid icon and the field icon. As a consequence, a field defined on a
tetrahedral grid cannot be loaded into the system if the grid itself is not
already present.</p>
<p>The class <em>HxRegScalarField3</em> represents a field which is defined on a
regular Cartesian grid. Such a grid is organized as a three-dimensional
array of nodes. In the most simple case these nodes are axis-aligned and
have equal spacings. The coordinates of such a uniform grid can be obtained
from a simple bounding box containing the origin vector and increments for
all directions. Stacked coordinates are another example. Here the spacing
in z-direction between subsequent slices may be different. In any case
scalar values inside a hexahedral grid cell are obtained from the eight
vertex values using trilinear interpolation. While the
<a class="link" href="../hxlattice/HxOrthoSlice.html#A1">OrthoSlice</a> module can only be used to visualize scalar
fields with uniform or stacked coordinates, other modules like 
<a class="link" href="../hxlattice/HxObliqueSlice.html#A1">ObliqueSlice</a> or <a class="link" href="../hxiso/HxIsosurface.html#A1">Isosurface</a>
work for all scalar fields with regular coordinates. </p>
<p>Yet another example of a scalar field is the class
<a class="link" href="../hxfield/HxAnnaScalarField3.html#A1">HxAnnaScalarField3</a>. It represents an
analytically defined scalar field. To create such a field, select <em>ScalarField</em> from the <em>Create</em> menu of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s main window. You
have to specify a mathematical expression which is used to evaluate the
field at each requested position. Up to three other fields can be connected
to the object. These can be combined to a new scalar field, even if they
are defined on different grids. </p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A3">3.2.2.2 Vector Fields</a></h4>
<p>As for scalar fields <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> provides a number of vector field classes, these
are derived from the base classes <em>HxVectorField3</em> and <em>HxComplexVectorField3</em>. While ordinary vector fields return a
three-component vector at each position, complex vector fields return a
six-component vector. Complex vector fields are used for encoding
stationary electromagnetic wave pattern as required by some applications.
Usually complex vector fields are visualized by projecting them into the 
space of reals using different phase offsets. The <a class="link" href="../hxvector/HxVectors.html#A1">Vectors</a>
module even allows you to animate the phase offset. In this way a nice
impression of the oscillating wave pattern is obtained.
