<h3><a name="A1">3.1.11 Job Dialog</a></h3>
<p>Certain time-consuming operations in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> can be performed in batch mode.
For this purpose <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> provides a job queue, where jobs like generation of
a tetrahedral grid can be submitted. You can inspect the current status of
the job queue, start and delete jobs from the queue by selecting <em>Dialogs -&gt; Jobs</em>
from <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s edit menu. This will bring up the <em>Job Dialog</em>.</p>
<p></p><div style="text-align:center"><a name="A2"></a><a href=jobdialog.png.html><img width=337 src="jobdialog.png" /></a><br />
<div class="caption">
<b>Figure 49:</b>
The job dialog lets you start, stop, examine, and delete batch
 jobs.</div>


</div><p></p>
<p>In the upper part of the job dialog the current list of jobs of a user
is shown. For each job a short description is displayed, as well as the
time when the job has been submitted and the current state of the job.
A job may be waiting for execution, running, finished, or it may have
been killed.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A3">The job directory</a></h4>
<p>For each job a temporary directory is created containing any required input
data, scripts, state information, and log files. On Unix systems this
directory is created at the location specified by the environment variable
<tt>TMPDIR</tt>. If no such variable exists, <tt>/tmp</tt> is used. On Windows
systems the default temporary directory is used. Typically this will be
<tt>C:/TEMP</tt>.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A4">Controlling the job queue</a></h4>
<p>A job's state may be manipulated using the action buttons shown above the
job list. In order to start the job queue select the first job waiting
for execution and then press the <em>Start</em> button. Note that only one
job can be executed at a time. In order to kill a running job, select
it in the job list and press the <em>Kill</em> button. You may delete a job
from the job queue using the <em>Delete</em> button. When deleting a job
the temporary job directory will be removed as well.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A5">Information about a job</a></h4>
<p>Once you have selected a job in the job queue, more detailed information
about it will be displayed in the lower part of the dialog window, notably
the state of the job, the temporary job directory, the submit
time, the time when the job has been started, the run time, and the name
of the command to be executed. Any console output of
a running job will be redirected to a log file located in the temporary job
directory. Once such a log file exists and has non-zero size you may
inspect it by pushing the <em>View output</em> button.</p>

<h3>Commands</h3>

<div class="hxcommand">
  <span class="headline">job submit <i>cmd</i> <i>info</i> <i>[tmpdir]</i></span>  

<div class="body"><p>
 Submits a new job to the job queue. <i>cmd</i> specifies the
 command to be executed. <i>info</i> specifies the info string
 displayed in the job dialog. <i>tmpdir</i> specifies the temporary
 job directory. If this argument is omitted a temporary job
 directory is created by <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> itself. In any case, the directory
 will be automatically deleted when the job is removed from the
 job queue. Example: <tt>job submit "clock.exe" "Test job"</tt></p>
</div></div>
<div class="hxcommand">
  <span class="headline">job run</span>  

<div class="body"><p>
 Starts the first job in job queue pending for execution. When
 a job is finished, execution of the next job in the queue
 starts automatically, thus all jobs in the queue will be
 executed consecutively by <tt>job run</tt>.</p>
