<h2><a name="A1">4.1 Data Import</a></h2>
<p>Usually, one of the first things <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> users want to know is how to import
their own data into the system. This section contains some advice intended
to ease this task. </p>
<p>In the simplest case, your data is already present in a standard file
format supported by <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>. To import such files, simply use the <em>File
Load</em> menu. A <a class="link" href="HxIndexFileFormat.html">list of all supported
formats</a> can be found in the index section of the user's guide. Usually, the
system recognizes the format of a file automatically by analyzing the file
header or the filename suffix. If a supported format is detected, the file
browser indicates the format name.</p>
<p>Often, <em>3D image volumes</em> are stored slice by slice using standard 2D
image formats such as TIFF or JPEG. In case of medical images, slices are
commonly stored in ACR-NEMA or DICOM format. If you select multiple 2D
slices simultaneously in the file browser, all slices will automatically
be combined into a single 3D data set. Simultaneous selection is most
easily achieved by first clicking the first slice and then shift-clicking
the last one.</p>
<p>If your data is not already present in a standard file format
supported by <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> you will have to write your own converter or export
filter. For many data objects such as 3D images, regular fields, or
tetrahedral grids <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s native <em>AmiraMesh</em> format is most
appropriate. Using this format you can even represent point sets or
line segments for which there is hardly any other standard format. The
<a class="link" href="../amiramesh/HxFileFormat_AmiraMesh.html#A1">AmiraMesh documentation</a> explains the
file syntax in detail and contains examples of how to encode different
data objects. One important <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> data type, triangular
non-manifold surfaces, cannot be represented in a <em>AmiraMesh</em> file
but has its own file format called
<a class="link" href="../hxsurface/HxFileFormat_HxSurface.html#A1">HxSurface</a> format.</p>
<p>Alternatively, with <font face="helvetica">Developer Option</font> a C++ programmer can extend <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> 
in order to integrate a custom reader or writer.</p>
<p>Finally, in case of images or regular fields with uniform coordinates
you may also read <a class="link" href="../hxfield/HxFileFormat_RawData.html#A1">binary raw data</a>. Note
that for raw data the dimensions and the bounding box of the data
volume must be entered manually in a dialog box which pops up after
you have selected the file in the file browser.</p>
