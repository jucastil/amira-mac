<h4><a name="A1">5.3.3.5 Progress bar command options</a></h4>
<p>The command <tt>workArea</tt> allows you to access the progress bar located
in the lower part of the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> main window. You can print messages or
check if the stop button was pressed.</p>
<p></p><div class="hxcommands">
<h3>Commands</h3>

<div class="hxcommand">
  <span class="headline">workArea setProgressInfo &lt;text&gt;</span>  

<div class="body"><p>Sets an info text to be displayed in the progress bar. The text
 can be used to describe the status during some computation.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="hxcommand">
  <span class="headline">workArea setProgressValue &lt;value&gt;</span>  

<div class="body"><p>Sets the value of the progress bar. The argument must be a floating
 point number between 0 and 1. For example, a value of 0.8 indicates
 that 80% of the current task has been done.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="hxcommand">
  <span class="headline">workArea startWorking [&lt;message&gt;]</span>  

<div class="body"><p>Activates the stop button. After calling this command the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>
 stop button becomes active. In your script you can check if the
 stop button was hit by calling <tt>workArea wasInterrupted</tt>.
 When the stop button is active you can't interact with any other
 widget unless you call <tt>workArea stopWorking</tt> in your
 script. Therefore you must not enter this command directly in the
 console window, but you should only use it in a script file or in
 a Tcl procedure.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="hxcommand">
  <span class="headline">workArea stopWorking</span>  

<div class="body"><p>Deactivates the stop button. Call this command when the compute
 task started with <tt>workArea startWorking</tt> is done or if the
 user pressed the stop button. This command also restores the progress
 info text which was shown before calling <tt>startWorking</tt>.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="hxcommand">
  <span class="headline">workArea wasInterrupted</span>  

<div class="body"><p>Checks if the user pressed the stop button. You should only use
 this command between <tt>workArea startWorking</tt> and <tt>workArea stopWorking</tt>. If there are multiple nested compute
 tasks and the user presses the stop button, all subsequent calls
 to <tt>wasInterrupted</tt> return true until the first level is
 reached.</p>
