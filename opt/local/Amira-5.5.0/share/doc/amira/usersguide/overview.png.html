<div style="text-align:center"><img src="overview.png" /><br />Data objects and modules are represented as little
 icons in the Pool (top left). In the 3D graphic window a
 surface colored according to its curvature is shown. Curvature 
 information has been computed by a computational module and is stored 
 as a separate data object.
 In the left window the parameters of selected modules are shown. The lower right pane
 provides a Tcl-command shell as well as access to the help browser.</div>
