<h3><a name="A1">3.1.8 Viewer Window</a></h3>
<p>The 3D viewer plays a central role in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>. Here all geometric objects are
shown in 3D space. The 3D viewer offers powerful and fast interaction
techniques. It can be regarded as a virtual camera which can be moved to an
arbitrary position within the 3D scene. The left mouse button is used to
change the view direction by means of a virtual trackball. The middle mouse
button is used for panning, while the left and the middle mouse button
pressed together allow you to zoom objects.</p>
<p>The following controls can be used:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>hold down left mouse button and move mouse pointer to rotate the camera around it's current focal point (the focal point can be changed by doing a seek operation)
<br />
</li><li>hold middle mouse button to pan <br />
</li><li>hold down left + middle mouse button to zoom / dolly, or CTRL + middle mouse button, or CTRL + SHIFT + the left mouse button <br />
</li><li>hold right mouse button opens the popup menu <br />
</li><li>press 's' key, then pick with the left mouse button to seek <br />
</li><li>press 'space' key to view all the 3D scene <br />
</li><li>press 'ESC' key to switch to and from 'interaction' mode and 'trackball' mode <br />
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>The virtual trackball controlled by the left mouse button allows for 
free rotation of the camera. The camera trackball, displayed by default
in the lower right corner of the viewer, is used for constrained 
rotation: rotation of the camera about the screen-aligned 
X, Y, or Z axes. Click on the vertical wheel (it becomes red when
you select it) and move the mouse
up/down (while left mouse button is pressed) to rotate about the X axis. 
Click on the horizontal wheel (it becomes
green when you select it)
and move the mouse left/right (while the left mouse button is pressed) 
to rotate about the Y axis. Click on the third wheel (it becomes blue) and move
the mouse up/down (with pressed left mouse button) to
rotate about the Z axis.



</p>
<p>A 3D compass indicating the current camera viewing direction may be displayed
in one of the corners of the display. It is an indicator
only, you cannot use it to control the viewing direction.</p>
<p>The <em>Edit/Preferences/Layout</em> dialog can be used to control the
visibility, auto-hide option, and position of the trackball and the compass.</p>
<p>Sometimes you need to manipulate objects directly in the 3D viewer. For
example, this technique, called 3D interaction, is used by the
<a class="link" href="../hxcore/HxTransformEditor.html#A1">transform editor</a>. You can switch on this editor
with the transform editor button in the properties of a data object.
The editor provides special
draggers that can be picked and translated or rotated in order to specify
the transformation of a data object. Before you can interact with these
draggers, you must switch the viewer into <em>interaction 
mode</em>. This is done by clicking on the arrow
button in the upper left corner. If the viewer is in interaction mode, the
mouse cursor will be an arrow instead of a hand symbol. You can use the
<tt>[ESC]</tt> key in order to quickly switch between interaction mode and
viewing mode. If the viewer is in interaction mode, use the <tt>[Alt]</tt> key
to temporarily switch to viewing mode.</p>

<b>Figure 46:</b>
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s viewer window provides a virtual trackball for easy
navigation, as well as a camera trackball (lower right) for constrained rotation.
</div>


</div><p>
</p>
<p>More than one viewer can be active at a time. Standard screen layouts with
one, two, or four viewers can be selected via the <a class="link" href="viewmenu.html#A1">View
menu</a>. Additional viewers can be created using the Tcl command <tt>viewer
&lt;n&gt; show</tt>, where <tt>&lt;n&gt;</tt> is an integer number between 0 and 13. While
viewers 0 to 3 will be placed in a common panel window, viewers 4 to 13 will
create their own top-level window. For more specific control, the viewer
provides an extensive command set, which is documented in
<a class="link" href="cmdViewer.html#A1">Section 5.3.3.1</a>.</p>
<p>The toolbar of the main viewer window provides several buttons and controls,
allowing you for example to switch between viewing mode and interaction mode, 
to choose certain orientations, or to take snapshots.
The precise meaning of these controls is described below.</p>
<p>
<b>Interact:</b> <br />
 
<img src="viewer_interact.png" /> <br />
 
Switches the viewer into interaction mode. You can also use
the <tt>[ESC]</tt> key to toggle between viewing mode and interaction mode.<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Trackball:</b> <br />
 
<img src="viewer_trackball.png" /> <br />
 Switches the viewer into viewing mode. You can also use the
<tt>[ESC]</tt> key to toggle between interaction mode and viewing mode.
The left mouse button is used to
change the view direction by means of a virtual trackball.<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Translate:</b> <br />

<img src="viewer_translate.png" /> <br />
 
Same as <em>Trackball</em> except that the left mouse button is used for 
panning (translation).<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Zoom:</b> <br />

<img src="viewer_zoom.png" /> <br />
 Same as <em>Trackball</em> except that in this mode vertical motion of 
the left mouse button controls zooming.<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Rotate:</b> <br />
 
<img src="viewer_rotate.png" /> <br />
 Rotates the camera
around the current view direction. By default, a clockwise rotation of
one degree is performed. If the Shift key is pressed while clicking, a
90 degree rotation is done. If the Ctrl key is pressed, the rotation
will be counterclockwise.<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Seek:</b> <br />

<img src="viewer_seek.png" /> <br />
 Pressing the seek button and then clicking on an arbitrary object in the
scene causes the object to be moved into the center of the viewer window.
Moreover, the camera will be oriented parallel to the normal direction at
the selected point. Seeking mode may also be activated by pressing the <tt>[S]</tt> key in the viewer window.<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Home:</b> <br />
 
<img src="viewer_home.png" /> <br />
 Resets camera to the home position.<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Set Home:</b> <br />
 
<img src="viewer_sethome.png" /> <br />
 Sets the current position as the new home position.<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Perspective/Ortho:</b> <br />
 
<img src="viewer_perspective.png" /> <img src="viewer_ortho.png" /> 
<br />
 Toggles between a perspective and an orthographic camera. By default, a
perspective camera is used. You may want to use an orthographic camera
in order to measure distances or to exactly align objects in 3D space.
<b>Note:</b> Only one of these buttons will be visible 
at a time, the button indicating the currently active camera type.
<br />
</p>
<p><b>View All:</b> <br />
 
<img src="viewer_viewall.png" /> or <img src="viewer_viewall_med.png" />
<br />
 Repositions the camera so that all objects become
visible. The orientation of the camera will not be changed.
<b>Note:</b> The first button is seen if <em>technical</em> naming or the 
geoscience template has been selected in 
the <em>Edit/Preferences/Layout</em> dialog, the second button 
will be displayed if <em>medical</em> naming has been selected.<br />

</p>
<p><b>YZ-, XY- and XZ-Views:</b> <br />
 
<img src="viewer_viewYZ.png" /> <img src="viewer_viewXY.png" /> <img src="viewer_viewXZ.png" />
or <img src="viewer_viewYZ_med.png" /> <img src="viewer_viewXY_med.png" /> <img src="viewer_viewXZ_med.png" /> 
<br />
 Adjusts the camera according to the specified viewing direction. The
viewing direction is parallel to the coordinate axis perpendicular to
the specified coordinate plane. Medical doctors are used to viewing series
of tomographic images parallel to the XY-plane with the y-axis pointing
downwards. This convention is followed by the XY-button. The opposite view
direction is used if the Shift key is pressed.
<b>Note:</b> The first set of buttons is seen if <em>technical</em> naming has been selected in 
the <em>Edit/Preferences/Layout dialog</em>, the second set of buttons 
will be displayed if <em>medical</em> naming has been selected. They correspond to
axial, coronal, and sagittal views respectively.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<b>Stereo:</b> <br />

<img src="viewer_stereo.png" /> <br />
 Allows you to enable or disable stereo viewing, as well as specify
various stereo viewing parameters via the 
<em>Stereo Preferences</em> dialog.<br />

</p>
<p>
<b>Measuring:</b> <br />

<img src="viewer_measure_2Drule.png" /> <img src="viewer_measure_3Drule.png" />
<img src="viewer_measure_2Dangle.png" /> <img src="viewer_measure_3Dangle.png" />
<img src="viewer_measure_anno2d.png" />
<img src="viewer_measure_anno.png" /> <br />
 Pressing this button creates an instance of a
<a class="link" href="../hxmeasure/HxMeasureTools.html#A1">Measuring</a> module that lets you measure distances
and angles on objects within the viewer. Clicking on the down arrow will
display a menu of measuring tools to chose from: <em>2D line</em>, <em>3D line</em>, <em>2D angle</em>,
<em>3D angle</em>, <em>2D annotation</em> and <em>3D annotation</em>. See the Measuring module's
documentation for details. <b>Note:</b> Only one of these buttons will be visible 
on the toolbar at a time, the button of
the measuring tool most recently accessed from the viewer toolbar.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Snapshot:</b> <br />
 
<img src="viewer_snapshot.png" /> <br />
 Takes a snapshot of the current rendering area and saves it in a file. The
filename as well as the desired output format must be entered through
the <a class="link" href="snapshotPrint.html">Snapshot dialog</a>. Snapshots may also be taken
using the <a class="link" href="cmdViewer.html#A1">viewer command</a> <tt>snapshot</tt>.<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Layout:</b> <br />

<img src="viewer_layout1.png" />
<img src="viewer_layout2V.png" /> <img src="viewer_layout2H.png" /> <img src="viewer_layout4.png" /> 
<br />
 Selects the viewer layout: a single view, two viewers side-by-side, 
two viewers stacked, or four viewers.<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Fullscreen:</b> <br />

<img src="viewer_fullscreen.png" /> <br />
 Selects fullscreen mode. In this mode, the viewer occupies the entire screen and
no other windows will be visible. To exit fullscreen mode, click the right mouse
button and uncheck <em>Fullscreen</em> in the popup menu.<br />
</p>
<p>
In addition to these buttons, the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> viewers provide an extensive set of
<a class="link" href="cmdViewer.html#A1">Tcl commands</a>, which are listed in <a class="link" href="cmdViewer.html#A1">Section 5.3.3.1</a>.</p>
