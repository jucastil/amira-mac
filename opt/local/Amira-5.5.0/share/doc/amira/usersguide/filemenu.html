<h3><a name="A1">3.1.1 File Menu</a></h3>
<p>The file menu lets you load and save data objects as well as <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> network
scripts. In addition, it gives you access to recent files and networks and allows
you to quit the program. In the following text, all menu entries are
discussed separately.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A2">3.1.1.1 Open Data</a></h4>
<p>The <em>Open Data</em> button activates <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s <a class="link" href="fileBrowser.html#A1">file dialog</a>
and lets you import data sets stored in a file. Most file formats supported
by <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> will be recognized automatically via the file header or the file
name extension. For each file, the file dialog will display its format. If
you try to load a file for which the format couldn't be detected
automatically, an additional dialog pops up asking you to select the format
manually. You may also manually set the file format for any file by
selecting the file, activating the file dialog's popup menu using the right
mouse button, and then choosing the <em>Format...</em> option.</p>
<p>A list of all <a class="link" href="HxIndexFileFormat.html">supported file formats</a> is
contained in the reference manual. Hints on how to import your own data
sets are given in <a class="link" href="dataimport.html#A1">Section 4.1</a>.</p>
<p>If you select multiple files in the file dialog, all of them will be
loaded, provided all of them are stored in the same format. 2D images
stored in separate files usually will be combined into a single 3D data
object. On the other hand, there are some file formats which cause multiple
data objects to be created. Finally, you can also import and execute <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>
network scripts using the <em>Load</em> button.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A3">3.1.1.2 Open Time Series Data</a></h4>
<p>This button also activates the <a class="link" href="fileBrowser.html#A1">file dialog</a>, but in
contrast to the ordinary <em>Load</em> option it is assumed that all selected
files represent different time steps of a single data object. When loading
such a time series an instance of a <a class="link" href="../hxtime/HxDynamicFileSeriesCtrl.html#A1">TimeSeriesControl</a>
module is created. This module provides a time slider
allowing you to adjust the current time step. Whenever a new time step is
selected the corresponding data file is read, and data objects associated
with a previous time step are replaced. The module also provides a cache so
that the data files only need to be read once provided the cache is large
enough.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A4">3.1.1.3 Save Data</a></h4>
<p>The <em>Save Data</em> button allows you to save a single modified data object
again using the same filename previously chosen under <em>Save Data As</em>.
The button will only be active if the data object to be saved is selected
and if this data object already has been saved using <em>Save Data As</em>. A
common application of the <em>Save</em> button is to store intermediate
results during manual segmentation in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s <a class="link" href="../hxsegeditor/GI.html#A1">image
segmentation editor</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A5">3.1.1.4 Save Data As</a></h4>
<p>This button lets you write a data object into a file. To do so you must
first select the data object (click on the corresponding green data icon).
Then choose <em>Save Data As</em> to activate <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s
<a class="link" href="fileBrowser.html#A1">file dialog</a>. The file dialog presents a list of all
formats suitable for saving that data object. Choose the one you like and
press <em>OK</em>. Note that you must specify the complete file name 
including the suffix. <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> will not automatically add a suffix to the
file name. However, it will update the suffix whenever you select a new
format from the file format list. Also, <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> will ask you before it
overwrites an existing file. </p>
<p>Some file formats create multiple files for a single data object. For
example, each slice of a 3D image data set might be saved as a separate
raster file. In this case, the file name may contain a sequence of
hashmarks. This sequence will be replaced by consecutive numbers formatted
with leading zeros.</p>
<p>If no file format at all has been registered for a certain type of data
object, the <em>Save as</em> button will be disabled. It will also be disabled
if more than one data object is selected in the Pool.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A6">3.1.1.5 New Network</a></h4>
<p>This button does a <em>Remove all objects</em> so that you can start 
building a new network in the Pool. It also sets the new
network name to Untitled.hx.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A7">3.1.1.6 Open Network</a></h4>
<p>The <em>Open Network</em> button activates <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s <a class="link" href="fileBrowser.html#A1">file dialog</a>
and lets you load a network stored in a file. Network files show up in the
dialog as being of format "<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> Script". A <em>Remove all objects</em> will be
done before the new network is loaded so that effectively the new network 
replaces the old network in the Pool. Currently only files with extension
.hx can be opened. </p>
<p>










</p>
<h4><a name="A8">3.1.1.7 Save Network</a></h4>
<p>This button allows you to save the complete network of icons and
connections shown in the Pool. 
If the network has not been previously saved, you will need to specify the name of
an <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> network script in the file dialog. When executed, the network
script restores all data objects and modules as well as the current
object transformations and the camera settings. The feature is useful for
resuming work at a point where it was left in a previous <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> run.</p>
<p>Note that usually all data objects must have been stored in a file in
order to be able to save the network. If this is not the case, a dialog is
popped up listing all the data objects that still need to be saved. In the
dialog you can specify that all required data objects should be saved
automatically in a separate subdirectory.</p>
<p>Instead of the option <em><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> script</em> you can also choose <em><font face="helvetica">Amira</font>
script and data files (pack &amp; go)</em> from the file dialog's format menu. In
this case <em>all</em> data objects currently loaded will be saved in a
separate directory. More options affecting the export of network scripts
can be adjusted in the <a class="link" href="preferences.html#A1">Preferences</a> dialog.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A9">3.1.1.8 Save Network As</a></h4>
<p>This button works like the <em>Save Network</em> button except that in this
case you will always need to specify the name of an <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> network script 
in the file dialog.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A10">3.1.1.9 Recent Files</a></h4>
<p>This button can be used to load recently used files. When choosing this menu
entry a submenu appears listing the five most recent files. If multiple 2D
images have been loaded this is indicated with the name of the first file
followed by three periods (...).</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A11">3.1.1.10 Recent Networks</a></h4>
<p>This button can be used to load recently used network scripts. When choosing
this menu entry a submenu appears listing the five most recent network scripts.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="A12">3.1.1.11 Quit</a></h4>
<p>This button terminates <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>. The current network configuration will be
lost unless you explicitly save it using <em>Save Network</em>.
