<h3><a name="A1">3.2.3 Coordinates and Grids</a></h3>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> currently supports two important grid types, namely grids with
hexahedral structure (regular grids), and unstructured tetrahedral grids.
Other types, e.g., unstructured grids with hexahedral cells or
block-structured grids will be added in future releases of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A2">3.2.3.1 Regular Grids</a></h4>
<p>A regular grid consists of a three-dimensional array of nodes. Each node
may be addressed by an index triple <em>(i,j,k)</em>. Regular grids are
further distinguished according to the kind of coordinates being used. The
most simple case comprises <em>uniform</em> coordinates, where all
cells are assumed to be rectangular and axis-aligned. Moreover, the grid
spacing is constant along each axis. A grid with <em>stacked</em> coordinates
may be imagined as a stack of uniform 2D slices. However, the distance
between neighboring slices in z-direction may vary. In case of <em>rectilinear</em> coordinates the cells are still aligned to the axes, but the
grid spacing may vary from cell to cell. Finally, in case of <em>curvilinear</em> coordinates each node of the grid may have arbitrary
coordinates. Grids with curvilinear coordinates are often used in fluid
dynamics because they have a simple structure but still allow for accurate
modeling of complex shapes like rotor blades or airfoils.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A3">3.2.3.2 Tetrahedral Grids</a></h4>
<p>The <em>TetraGrid</em> class represents a volumetric grid composed of many
tetrahedrons. Such grids can generally be used to perform finite-element
simulations, e.g., E-field simulations.</p>
<p>A considerable amount of information is maintained in a <em>TetraGrid</em>.
For each vertex a 3D coordinate vector is stored. For each tetrahedron the
indices of its four vertices are stored as well as a number indicating the
segment the tetrahedron belongs to as obtained by a segmentation procedure.
Beside this fundamental information a number of additional variables are
stored in order for the grid being displayed quickly. In particular all
triangles or faces are stored separately together with six face indices for
each tetrahedron. In addition for each face pointers to the two
tetrahedrons it belongs to are stored. This way the neighborhood
information can be obtained efficiently.</p>
<p>When simulating E-fields using the finite-element method, the edges of a
grid need to be stored explicitly, because vector or Whitney
elements are used. These elements and its corresponding coefficients are
defined on a per-edge basis. When a grid is selected information on the
number of its vertices, edges, faces, and tetrahedrons is displayed.
