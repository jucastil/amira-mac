<h3><a name="A1">3.2.6 Transformations</a></h3>
<p>Data objects in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> can be modified using an arbitrary affine
transformation. For example, this makes it possible to align two different
data objects so that they roughly match each other. Internally, affine
transformations are represented by a 4x4 transformation matrix. In
particular, a uniform scalar field remains a uniform scalar field, even if
it is rotated or sheared. Display modules like <em>OrthoSlice</em> still can
exploit the simple structure of the uniform field. The possible
transformation is automatically applied to any geometry shown in the 3D
viewer.</p>
<p>In order to interactively manipulate the transformation matrix use the
<a class="link" href="../hxcore/HxTransformEditor.html#A1">Transform Editor</a> (documentation is contained
in the index section of the user's guide).</p>
<p>Be careful when saving transformed data sets! Most file formats do not
allow to store affine transformations. In this case you have to apply the
current transformation to the data. This can be done using the Tcl-command
<tt>applyTransform</tt>. In case of <a class="link" href="../hxcore/HxVertexSet.html#A1">vertex set objects</a> the
transformation is applied to all vertices. Old coordinates are replaced by
new ones, and the transformation matrix is reset to identity afterwards.
After a transformation has been applied to a data set, it cannot be unset
easily anymore.</p>
<p>If a transformation is applied to uniform fields, e.g., to 3D image data,
the coordinate structure is not changed, i.e., the field remains a uniform
one. Instead, the data values are resampled, i.e., the transformed field is
evaluated at every vertex of the final regular grid. The bounding box of
the resulting grid is modified so that it completely encloses the
transformed original box.
