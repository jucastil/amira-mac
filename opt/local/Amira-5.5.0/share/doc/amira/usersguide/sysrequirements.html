<h2><a name="A1">4.5 System Requirements</a></h2>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> runs on:
</p>
<ul><li>Windows XP(Service Pack 3)/Vista/7, 32-bit</li><li>Windows XP(Service Pack 3)/Vista/7 (Intel 64/AMD64 architecture), 64-bit</li><li>Mac OS X 10.5/10.6/10.7 with Intel CPU</li><li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 for x86_64 or compatible</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> relies on hardware-accelerated OpenGL 3D graphics.
Please note that if software rendering is used, rendering performance
may drop significantly, especially for visualization techniques like
volume rendering.
Some visualization techniques may also require 3D texturing or programmable shaders, 
available on recent graphics boards.
For platform-specific details on hardware acceleration, see below.</p>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> requires a display resolution of at least 1024x768
and at least 15 bits of color depth. We strongly recommend 1280x1024 with 
24-bit color depth at least.<br />
</p>
<p>Apart from 3D graphics hardware, probably the most important system
parameter is main memory. You should have at least 512 MB, preferably
2 GB or more. </p>
<p>The speed of the processor of course is also an important
parameter. However it is less critical than the graphics system
and the main memory size. For the PC versions, we recommend
at least a 2 GHz processor.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A2">4.5.1 Troubleshooting</a></h3>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is a very demanding application that extensively uses high-end
features. Experience shows that such applications tend to reveal
instabilities in system hardware, hardware drivers, and the operating
system. A common problem is insufficient main memory. We recommend you
configure enough swap memory in addition to physical memory. The
total amount of virtual memory should be at least 1 GB. 2 GB would be
even better. Especially on PC platforms, OpenGL drivers today are not always as
robust as desired. Also, system crashes due to bad memory chips or
unstable power-supply are not rare. If you experience problems or
instabilities with <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> on your Windows platform, we recommend that 
you follow these steps:</p>
<ol><li>Click on all the demo scripts in the Online User's Guide. If the
 system crashes, turn off hardware acceleration (choose the <i>extended</i> button from the Windows display settings dialog) and try
 again. If this eliminates the problem, there is a bug in your OpenGL
 driver. Try to get a new driver from the web site of the manufacturer
 of your graphics board.</li><li><p>Try using a different color depth in the Windows display settings
 dialog. Try 24 or 32 bit.</p></li><li>Load the <tt>lobus.am</tt> data set and visualize it with a Voltex module.

 Turn on the spin rotation (turn it with the mouse in the viewer and
 release the mouse button while moving the mouse, so that the object
 continues moving). Let it run overnight (turn off the screen saver).
 If the system has crashed or frozen the next morning, you probably have
 a hardware problem.</li>
</ol><p></p>
<p>If this does not help, or if a reproducible error occurs on different
computers, then it might be a bug in the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> software itself. Please
report such bugs so that they can be eliminated in the next release
or a patch can be prepared.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A3">4.5.2 Microsoft Windows</a></h3>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> runs on Intel or AMD-based systems with Microsoft Windows
XP (Service Pack 3), Microsoft Windows Vista, and Microsoft
Windows 7, 32 bits and 64 bits.</p>
<p><b>Graphics Hardware:</b> You should use a graphics board with
OpenGL support and texture mapping capabilities. 
Some visualization techniques may also require 3D texturing and programmable shaders, 
available on recent graphics boards.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> On Windows Vista/7, you may want to disable Windows Aero for saving hardware resources 
and achieving best 3D performance with <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>.
In Control Panel, open <em>Appearance and Personalization</em>, then click <em>Personalization</em>. 
You can alternatively right-click an empty spot on your desktop and click <em>Personalize</em> in pop-up.
Click <em>Window Color and Appearance</em>, and then click <em>Open Classic Appearance Properties 
for More Color Options</em>. Now you can select a <em>Color scheme</em> different from Windows Aero, such as the Windows classic theme.</p>
<p>In order to add custom extensions to <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> with <font face="helvetica">Developer Option</font> you
will need Visual Studio 2005 for the 32 bit version of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>
and Visual Studio 2008 for the 64 bit version. </p>
<p>To run the debug version of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> an installed Visual Studio is
required.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A4">4.5.3 Linux</a></h3>
<p>The Linux version of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> as been developed and tested on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5.5. </p>
<p>On other Linux distributions this version might not run because
certain required system libraries are missing or because different
versions of these libraries are installed. In particular you may need to install 
<tt>libstdc++.so.5</tt> included in the compat-libstdc++ package (or you may copy it 
into the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> installation directory under <tt>lib/arch-Linux...-Optimize/</tt>).</p>
<p>On Linux, <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is only available for AMD64 / Intel 64 systems.</p>
<p><b>Graphics Hardware:</b> <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> works with the current 3D graphics drivers from nVidia and ATI
under XFree86 4/Xorg. </p>
<p><b>Notes:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>After a standard installation of Linux, 
hardware acceleration is not necessarily activated, although X-Windows and 
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> may work fine. To enable OpenGL hardware acceleration specific drivers 
may have to be installed. 
This can dramatically increase rendering performance. 
Sometimes it is necessary to disable the stencil buffers (by starting <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> 
with the option -no_stencils) to get acceleration.<br />
</li><li>On some distribution, you may see incorrect display of some parts of the user interface, 
such as the segmentation editor. This is a known Qt issue. You can work around this by disabling the composite option in the extension section of your XFree86.conf or Xorg.conf configuration file:<br />

<pre>
Section "Extensions" 
     Option      "Composite"     "disable" 
EndSection 
</pre></li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>In order to add custom extensions to <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> with <font face="helvetica">Developer Option</font> you will need gcc 4.1.x on RHEL 5.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A5">4.5.4 Mac OS</a></h3>
<p>The Mac version of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> has been developed and tested on Mac
OS X 10.5 (Leopard), 10.6 (Snow Leopard), and 10.7 (Lion) running on an Intel CPU.
This version might not work properly on other Mac OS releases or
non-Intel CPU Apple platforms.</p>
<p>In order to add custom extensions to <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> with <font face="helvetica">Developer Option</font> you will need gcc 4.2.x provided by 
the standard XCode development environment.</p>
<p><b>Graphics Hardware:</b> <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> works with the current Mac 3D graphics drivers from nVidia 
and ATI.</p>
