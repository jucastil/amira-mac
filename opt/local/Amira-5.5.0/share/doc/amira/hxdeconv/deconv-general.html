<h3><a name="A1">14.1.1 General remarks about image deconvolution</a></h3>
<p>Deconvolution is a technique for removing out-of-focus light in a series of
images recorded via optical sectioning microscopy. Intended to investigate 
3D biological objects, optical sectioning microscopy works by creating
multiple images (optical sections) of a fluorescing object, each with a
different focal plane. However, besides the in-focus structures, the images
usually also contain out-of-focus light from other parts of the object,
causing haze and severe axial blurring. This is even the case for a confocal
laser scanning microscope, where most of the out-of-focus light is removed
from the image by a pinhole system. Mathematically, the image produced by
any microscopic system can be described as the convolution of the ideal
unblurred image of the specimen and the microscope's so-called point spread
function (PSF), i.e., the image of an ideal point light source. With the
inverse of this process, called deconvolution, a deblurred image of the
specimen can be obtained, provided the point spread function is known, or at
least can be estimated.
The <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> deconvolution modules mainly provide two variants of a powerful
iterative maximum-likelihood image restoration algorithm, namely a
non-blind one and a blind one. The difference between them is
that in the first case a measured or computed point spread function is
used, while in the second case the PSF is estimated along with the data
itself. Maximum-likelihood image restoration can be considered as the
de-facto standard for deconvolution of 3D optical sections. Although
computationally quite expensive, the method is able to significantly
enhance image quality. At the same time it is very robust and insensitive
with respect to noise artifacts. However, it should be noted that, although
rejecting most of the out-of-focus light, by no means all of it is
rejected. Therefore, some noticeable haze remains in the images. Also,
the images retain a substantial axial smearing in z-direction, which cannot
be removed by any deconvolution algorithm.</p>
<p>At first sight, one may wonder why both a non-blind and a blind
deconvolution algorithm are provided; blind deconvolution 
seems to be more general because the PSF is calculated automatically. One
answer is that blind deconvolution is computationally even more expensive
than non-blind iterative maximum-likelihood image restoration. The other
answer is that in a blind deconvolution algorithm a meaningful estimate of
the PSF can only be computed if severe constraints are imposed. For
example, a trivial solution of the blind deconvolution problem would be
an image which is identical to the input image and a PSF with the
shape of an ideal delta peak. Obviously, this solution isn't useful at all.
Therefore, if for example confocal data is to be deconvolved, the algorithm
fits the actual PSF in such a way that it looks like a possible measured PSF of a confocal microscope.
More precisely, the fit is constrained to be in agreement with the experimental
parameters (the refractive index of the medium, the numerical aperture of the objective,
and the voxel sizes).
Sometimes this can lead to wrong results, for example when the confocal
pinhole aperture of the microscope wasn't stopped down sufficiently 
during confocal image acquisition, in which case the microscope
actually didn't behave like a true confocal microscope. As a matter of fact
you should try which approach provides the best results for your own image
data, blind deconvolution or non-blind deconvolution with either a measured
or an automatically computed PSF.</p>
