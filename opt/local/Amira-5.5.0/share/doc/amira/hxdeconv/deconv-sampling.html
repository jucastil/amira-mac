<h3><a name="A1">14.1.2 Data acquisition and sampling rates</a></h3>
<p>In order to obtain best quality when deconvolving microscopic images some
fundamental guidelines should be obeyed during image aquisition. Good
results may be obtained even if some of these guidelines are not followed
exactly, but in general the chances to get satisfactory results improve if
they are. Below we discuss the most important recommendations.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A2">Adjusting the Scanned Image Volume</a></h3>
<p>The region of interest should be centered in the middle of the image
volume, as the optics of the microscope has usually the least aberrations
in this region and it helps to avoid possible boundary artifacts, which can
arise during the deconvolution procedure. 
Especially for widefield data it is important to
record a sufficiently large (preferably empty) region below and above the
actual sample. Ideally, this region should be as large as the sample
itself. For example, if the sample covers 100 micrometers in the z-direction,
the scanned image volume should range from 50 micrometers below the sample
to 50 micrometers above it.
</p>
<h3><a name="A3">Choosing the Right Sampling Rate</a></h3>
<p>The sampling rate is determined by the pixel sizes in the x and y directions as well as
the distance between two subsequent optical sections, both measured in
micrometers. Generally speaking, image deconvolution works best if the
data is apparently oversampled, i.e., if the pixel or optical section
spacing is smaller than required. 
The maximal required sampling distance (Nyquist sampling) to avoid ambiguities
in the data can be obtained from considerations in Fourier-space yielding
</p>\[
    d_{xy} = \frac{\lambda}{4\,N\!A},
\]<p>
where $$\lambda$$ denotes the wavelength and $$N\!A$$ is the numerical aperture
of the microscope. Similar considerations yield for the maximal 
distance between adjacent image planes:
</p>\[
    d_z = \frac{\lambda}{2\, n \, (1-\cos (\alpha))},
\]<p>
where $$n$$ denotes the refractive index of the object medium and $$alpha$$ the aperture half angle
as determined by $$N\!A = n\,\sin (\alpha)$$.
For a confocal microscope, both the in-plane sampling distance and the axial
sampling distance need to be in theory approximately 2 times smaller.
However, this requirement is far too strict for most practical cases and even in the widefield case,
approximately fullfilling the above requirements is often sufficient.
The total number of optical sections is obtained by dividing the height of
the image volume by the sampling distance $$d_z$$. It should be mentioned
that deconvolution also works if the sampling distances are not matched
rigorously, but matching them improves the chances to get good results. In
general, oversampling the object is less harmful than undersampling it, with one
exception: In the case of confocal data, the sampling distance $$d_{xy}$$ should
not be much smaller than indicated, if the blind deconvolution algorithm or
the non-blind deconvolution algorithm together with a theoretically
computed confocal PSF are used. Otherwise the unconstrained Maximum Likelihood
algorithm and the predominant noise in the data might lead to unsatisfactory
results.
</p>
<h3><a name="A4">Black Level and Saturation</a></h3>
<p>Before grabbing images from the microscope's camera, the light level should
be adjusted in such a way that saturated pixels, either black or white
ones, are avoided. Saturated pixels are pixels which are clamped to either
black or white because their actual intensity values are outside the range
of representable intensities. In any case, saturation means a loss of
information and thus prevents proper post-processing or deconvolution.
At the same time, a high background level should be avoided 
because it decreases the
dynamic range of the imaging system and the deconvolution works worse. 
This means that empty regions not showing any fluorescence should appear 
almost black. A background level close to zero
is especially important when bead measurements are performed in order to extract
an experimental point spread function. Details are discussed is a separate
tutorial about <a class="link" href="deconvtut3.html#A1">bead extraction</a>.</p>
