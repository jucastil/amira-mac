<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This module can be used to
resample and average the image of one or multiple beads, i.e., fluorescing
sub-resolution microspheres, thereby obtaining an approximation of a point
spread function (PSF) required for non-blind deconvolution.
The module must be connected to the image data set containing the measured
beads as well as to a landmark set indicating the center positions of all
beads to be resampled and averaged. The whole process of obtaining a point
spread function from a bead measurement is described in a separate
<a class="link" href="deconvtut3.html#A1">tutorial on bead extraction</a>. Please refer
to this tutorial for more information on how to use the module.
Press the <em>Apply</em> button to actually extract the beads with the center 
of the resulting data set corresponding to the current positions of the 
landmarks. The image volume around every landmark is
extracted and resampled using a Lanczos filter (compare the
<a class="link" href="../hxarith/HxResample.html#A1">Resample</a> module). The resampled bead images are
then added to the result object. The final PSF is not normalized.</p>

<div class="body"><p><i>Adjust centers:</i> If this button is pressed, the landmark positions
of the data set connected to port <a class="link" href="#A3">Landmarks</a>
are shifted to the center of gravity of the corresponding bead. It is
required that the initial landmark positions be inside the bead images
and that neighboring beads do not overlap significantly. Otherwise
incorrect center positions may be computed.</p>
<p><i>Estimate size:</i> If this button is pressed, the desired number of voxels
of the final PSF image specified in port
<a class="link" href="#A4">Resolution</a> are computed automatically.
Before this is done the beads' center positions already should have been
adjusted. The estimate is computed by determining the extent of the biggest
spot around any landmark. Again, it is required that neighboring beads do
not overlap significantly. The <i>Estimate size</i> button becomes
insensitive if a result object is connected to the module. In this case
always the size of the existing PSF image will be used.</p>
<p><i>Undo:</i> Undoes the effect of any of the previous two buttons. For
example, if wrong center positions have been computed after pressing <i>Adjust centers</i>, the original landmark positions can be restored using the
<i>Undo</i> button.</p>
