<h2><a name="A1">24.7 Adding a Read Routine</a></h2>
<p>As will be explained in more detail in <a class="link" href="HxDev-reader.html#A1">Section 25.2</a>, read
routines are global C++ functions used to create one or more
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> data objects from the contents of a file stored in a certain file
format. To create the template of a new read routine, first the
name of the routine must be specified (see <a class="link" href="#A2">Figure 186</a>).
The name must be a valid C++ name. It must not contain blanks or any other
special characters.

<p>Moreover, the name of the file format and the preferred file name extension
must be specified. The extension will be used by the file browser in order
to identify the file format. The format name will be displayed next to any
matching file.
Finally, a toggle can be set in order to create the template of a read
routine supporting the input of multiple files. Such a routine will have
a slightly different signature. It allows you to create a single data object
from multiple input files. For example, multiple 2D image files can be
combined in a single 3D image volume. Details are provided in
<a class="link" href="HxDev-readdetails.html#A1">Section 25.2.3</a>.
After you press <em>OK</em> a new file <tt>&lt;name&gt;.cpp</tt> will be created in the
package directory, where <tt>&lt;name&gt;</tt> denotes the name of the read
routine. In addition, the read routine will be registered in the package
resource file. Some file formats can be identified by a unique file header,
not just by the file name extension. In such a case you may want
to modify the resource file entry as described in
<a class="link" href="HxDev-readppm3d.html#A1">Section 25.2.1</a>. </p>
<p>Remember, that after you have added a new read routine to a package you
need to recreate the build system files before you can compile it. Details
are described in <a class="link" href="HxDev-devcreatebuildsystem.html#A1">Section 24.9</a>.</p>
