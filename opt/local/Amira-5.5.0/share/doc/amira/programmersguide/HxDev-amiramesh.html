<h2><a name="A1">25.4 The AmiraMesh API</a></h2>
<p>Besides many standard file formats, <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> also provides its own native format
called AmiraMesh. The AmiraMesh file format is very flexible. It can be used to
save many different data objects including image data, finite-element grids, and
solution data defined on such grids. Among other features it supports ASCII or
binary data encoding, data compression, and storage of arbitrary parameters.
The format itself is described in more detail in the reference section of the
user's guide. In this section we want to discuss how to save custom data
objects in AmiraMesh format. For this purpose a special C++ utility class
called <tt>AmiraMesh</tt> is provided. Using this class, reading and writing
AmiraMesh files becomes very easy.
Below we will first provide an <a class="link" href="HxDev-amoverview.html#A1">overview</a> of the
AmiraMesh API. After that, we present two simple examples. In the first
one we show how colormaps are <a class="link" href="HxDev-amwrite.html#A1">written</a> in AmiraMesh
format. In the second one we show how such colormaps are
<a class="link" href="HxDev-amread.html#A1">read back</a> again.</p>
