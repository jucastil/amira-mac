<h2><a name="A1">25.2 Read Routines</a></h2>
<p>As already mentioned in the previous section, a read routine is a C++
function that
reads a disk file, interprets the data, creates an instance of an <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>
data class, and fills that instance with the data read from the file.
In order to write a read routine, obviously two things are needed, namely
a specification of the file format to be read as well as the information
which of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s data classes is able to represent the data and how this
class is used. More information about the standard <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> data classes is
given in <a class="link" href="HxDev-dataobjs.html#A1">Chapter 27</a>. The C++ interface of these
classes is described in the online reference documentation.</p>
<p>A read routine may either be a static member function of a class or a
global function. In addition to the function itself, an entry in the
package resource file is needed. In this way <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is informed about the
existence of the read routine and about the type of files that can be
handled by the reader.</p>
<p>In the following discussion the implementation of a user-defined read 
routine will be
illustrated by two concrete examples, namely <a class="link" href="HxDev-readppm3d.html#A1">a simple
read routine for scalar fields</a> and <a class="link" href="HxDev-readtrimesh.html#A1">a read routine
for surfaces and surface fields</a>. Some
<a class="link" href="HxDev-readdetails.html#A1">more details about read routines</a> will be discussed
subsequently.</p>
