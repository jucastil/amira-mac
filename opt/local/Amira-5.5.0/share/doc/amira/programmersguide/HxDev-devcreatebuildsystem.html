<h2><a name="A1">24.9 Creating the Build System Files</a></h2>
<p>Before you can actually compile your own packages you need to create
project files for Visual Studio on Windows or GNUmakefiles for Unix. These
files contain information such as the source code files to be compiled, or
the correct include and library paths. Since it is not trivial to set up and
edit these files manually, <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> provides a mechanism to create them
automatically. In order to do this, a so-called
<a class="link" href="HxDev-packagefile.html#A1">Package</a> file must exist in each package. The Package
files contains the name of the package and a list of dependent packages. It
may also contain additional tags to customize the build process. The syntax
of the package file is described in <a class="link" href="HxDev-packagefile.html#A1">Section 24.10</a>.
However, usually there is no need to modify the default Package file
created by the development wizard. While the automatic generation of the build system files is a very helpful
feature it also means that you better do not modify the resulting project or
GNUmakefiles manually, because they might be easily overwritten by <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>.</p>

Creating the build system files.</div>


</div><p></p>
<p>If you select <em>Create build system</em> on the main page of the development
wizard and then press the <em>Next</em> button, the controls shown in Figure
<a class="link" href="#A2">188</a> will be activated. You can choose if you want to create the
build system files for all local packages or just for a particular one.
Depending on the selected build system the following files will be created:</p>
<p><br />

<b>GNUmakefiles</b></p>
<p><tt>share/src/mypackage/GNUmakefile</tt>: A GNUmakefile for building <em>mypackage</em>. If <em>all local packages</em> is selected such a file will be
created in every subdirectory containing a <em>Package file</em>.</p>
<p>In order to compile all local packages at once, you can type <em>gmake</em>
in the local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> directory. In this directory there is a standard
GNUmakefile which calls <em>gmake</em> in all package directories.</p>
<p><br />

<b>Visual Studio</b></p>
<p><tt><font face="monospace">Amira</font>Local.vc8.sln / <font face="monospace">Amira</font>Local.vc90.sln</tt>: A
workspace containing projects for all local packages. This file will
only be written if <em>all local packages</em> is selected in the
development wizard.</p>
<p><tt>all<font face="monospace">Amira</font>Local.vc80.vcproj /
 all<font face="monospace">Amira</font>Local.vc90.vcproj</tt>: A project file which depends
on all other projects. Choose this project as active project in Visual
Studio if you want to compile all local packages.</p>
<p><tt>doc<font face="monospace">Amira</font>Local.vc80.vcproj /
 doc<font face="monospace">Amira</font>Local.vc90.vcproj</tt>: A project for creating the
documentation for all local packages. This file will only be written
if <em>all local packages</em> is selected in the development wizard.</p>
<p><tt>share/src/mypackage/mypackage.vc80.vcproj
 /<br />
 share/src/mypackage/mypackage.vc90.vcproj</tt>: A project for
building <em>mypackage</em>. If <em>all local packages</em> is selected such
a file will be created in every subdirectory containing a <em>Package</em> file.</p>
<p>The syntax of the <em>Package</em> file is described in the
<a class="link" href="HxDev-packagefile.html#A1">following section</a>.</p>
