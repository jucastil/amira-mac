<h2><a name="A1">24.8 Adding a Write Routine</a></h2>
<p>A write routine is a global C++ function which takes a pointer to some
data object and writes the data to a file in a certain file format.
The details are explained in <a class="link" href="HxDev-writer.html#A1">Section 25.3</a>. In order to create the
template of a new write routine, the name of the routine must first be
specified (see <a class="link" href="#A2">Figure 187</a>). The name must be a valid C++
name. It must not contain blanks or any other special characters.

<p>In addition, the name of the file format and the preferred file name
extension must be specified. Before saving a data object, both the
name and the extension will be displayed in the file format menu of
the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> file browser.</p>
<p>Finally, the C++ class name of the data object to be saved must be chosen
as well as the package this class is defined in. Some important data
objects such as a <tt>HxUniformScalarField3</tt> or a <tt>HxSurface</tt> are
already listed in the corresponding combo box. However, any other class,
including custom classes, may be specified here. Instead of the name of a
data class, even the name of an interface class such as <tt>HxLattice3</tt>
may be used (see <a class="link" href="HxDev-reglattice.html#A1">Section 27.2.1</a>).</p>
<p>After you press <em>OK</em>, a new file <tt>&lt;name&gt;.cpp</tt> will be created in the
package directory, where <tt>&lt;name&gt;</tt> denotes the name of the write
routine. In addition, the write routine will be registered in the package
resource file. </p>
<p>Remember, that after you have added a new write routine to a package you
need to recreate the build system files before you can compile it. Details
are described in <a class="link" href="HxDev-devcreatebuildsystem.html#A1">Section 24.9</a>.</p>
