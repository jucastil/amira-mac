<h2><a name="A1">23.1 Overview of <font face="helvetica">Developer Option</font></a></h2>
<p><font face="helvetica">Developer Option</font> is an extension to the ordinary <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> 
version. In addition to the files contained in the ordinary version, the
developer version essentially provides all C++ header files needed to
compile custom extensions.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A2">23.1.1 Packages and Shared Objects</a></h3>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is an object-oriented software system. Besides the core components
like the graphical user interface or the 3D viewers, it contains a large
number of data objects, modules, readers and writers. Data objects and
modules are C++ classes, readers and writers are C++ functions.
Instead of being compiled into a single static executable, these
components are grouped into <em>packages</em>. A package is a
shared object (usually called .so or .sl on Unix or .dll on Windows)
which can be dynamically loaded by <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> at run time when needed. This
concept has two advantages. On the one hand, the program remains small
since only those packages are loaded which are actually needed by the
user. On the other hand it provides almost unlimited extensibility
since new packages can be added any time without recompiling the main
program.
Therefore, in order to add custom components to the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> developer
version, new packages or shared objects must be created and compiled. A
package may contain an arbitrary number of modules and it is left up to the
developer whether he wants to organize his modules into several packages or
just in one.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A3">23.1.2 Package Resource Files</a></h3>
<p>Along with each package a <em>resource file</em> is stored. This
file contains information about the components being defined in a
particular package. When <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> starts, it first scans the resource files of
all available packages and thus knows about all the components which
may be used at run-time.
The resource files of the standard <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> packages are located under <tt>share/resources</tt> in the directory where <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is installed. Details about
registering read and write routines or different kinds of modules in a
resource file are provided in <a class="link" href="HxDev-fileio.html#A1">Chapters 25</a> and
<a class="link" href="HxDev-modules.html#A1">26</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A4">23.1.3 The Local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> Directory</a></h3>
<p>Usually <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> will be installed by the system administrator at a location
where ordinary users are not allowed to create or modify files. Therefore
it is recommended that every user creates new packages in his own personal
<em>local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> directory</em>. The local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> directory has essentially the
same structure as the directory where <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is installed. A new local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>
directory can most easily be created by using the <em>Development
Wizard</em>, a special-purpose dialog box described in detail in
<a class="link" href="HxDev-wizard.html#A1">Section 24</a>. 
Once a local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> directory has been set up, resource files located in 
it will also be scanned by <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> when started. In this way new components
can be added or existing ones redefined. </p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A5">23.1.4 External Libraries</a></h3>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is based on a number of industry standard libraries. The most
important ones are <em>Open Inventor</em>, <em>OpenGL</em>, <em>Qt</em>, and <em>Tcl</em>. 
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s 3D graphics is based on OpenGL and Open Inventor. OpenGL is the
industry standard for professional 3D graphics. Open Inventor is a C++
library using OpenGL which provides an object-oriented scene
description layer. Writing new visualization modules for <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> essentially
means creating an Open Inventor scene from the input data. If you
already have code doing this, it will be straightforward to turn it into
an <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> module. A subset of the Open Inventor headers is included in <font face="helvetica">Developer Option</font>, 
OpenGL must already be installed on your system.</p>
<p>Qt is a platform-independent C++ library for building graphical user
interfaces (GUIs). <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is built with Qt. However, the user interface
elements used in standard <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> modules are encapsulated by special <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>
classes called <em>ports</em>. Therefore you can develop your own modules 
without knowing Qt. You only need Qt if you plan
to add completely new user interface components such as special purpose
dialogs.
Finally, Tcl is a C library providing an extensible scripting language
used by <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>. All required header files are included in <font face="helvetica">Developer Option</font>. 
Detailed knowledge of the Tcl API is usually not needed, as most of the code
can be derived from existing examples.
