<h2><a name="A1">24.2 Setting Up the Local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> Directory</a></h2>
<p>The local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> directory contains the source code and the binaries of all
custom extensions developed by a user. The name of this directory can be
most easily specified using the development wizard (see
<a class="link" href="#A2">Figure 182</a>). Since potentially every user can write his/her own
extensions for <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> it is usually recommended that the local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>
directory is created in the user's home directory.

Setting the local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> directory.</div>


</div><p></p>
<p>If the specified directory does not exist the development wizard asks you
whether it should be created. If you confirm, the directory itself together
with some subdirectories will be created. You may also specify an existing
empty directory in the text field. Then the subdirectories will be created
in there. </p>
<p>Finally, you may choose an existing directory which has been created by
the development wizard before. In this case a simple check is performed to
determine whether the specified directory is valid. If you want to use a
directory created with <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> 3.0 or an earlier version, please first refer
to <a class="link" href="HxDev-upgrading.html#A1">Section 23.6</a> (upgrading existing code).</p>
<p>In order to unset the local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> directory you should clear the text
field and press <em>OK</em>. The directory will not be deleted, but the next
time <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is started modules and IO routines defined in the local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>
directory will not be available anymore.</p>
<p>Once you have set up the local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> directory, the name of the directory is
stored permanently, so the next time <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> is started the .rc-files located
in the subdirectory <tt>share/resources</tt> of the local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> directory can
be read. In this way custom components are made known to <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>. On Windows
the name of the local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> directory is stored in the Windows registry.
On Unix systems it is stored in the file <tt>.<font face="monospace">Amira</font>Registry</tt> in the user's
home directory. In both cases, these setting can be overridden by defining
the environment variable <tt>AMIRA_LOCAL</tt>.
The development wizard also provides a toggle for copying a demo package to
the local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> directory. You will get a warning if this button is
activated and an existing local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> directory already containing the
demo package has been specified. The demo package is copied to the
subdirectory <tt>src/mypackage</tt> in the local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> directory. It contains
all read and write routines and modules presented as examples in this
guide. 
<b>Please note:</b> On Unix systems shared objects in the local
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> directory cannot use other shared objects in this
directory. To circumvent this limitation add the lib directory
(<tt>amiralocal/lib/arch-LinuxAMD64-*</tt>) to the
<tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> environment variable.
