<h2><a name="A1">27.3 Unstructured Tetrahedral Data</a></h2>
<p>Another important type of data refers to fields defined on unstructured
tetrahedral grids. Such grids are often used in finite element simulations
(FEM). In <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>, tetrahedral grids and data fields defined on such grids 
are implemented by two different classes or groups of classes and are 
also distinguished in the user interface by different icons. The reason 
is that by separating grid and data there is no need for replicating the
grid in case many fields are defined on the same grid, a case that occurs
frequently in practice.</p>
<p>In the following two sections, we introduce the
<a class="link" href="HxDev-tetragrid.html#A1">grid class</a> <tt>HxTetraGrid</tt> before discussing the
corresponding <a class="link" href="HxDev-tetradata.html#A1">field classes</a> and the interface <tt>HxTetraData</tt>.</p>
