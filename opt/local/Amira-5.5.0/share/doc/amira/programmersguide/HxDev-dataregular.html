<h2><a name="A1">27.2 Data on Regular Grids</a></h2>
<p>Fields defined on a regular grid occur in many different applications. For
example, 3D image volumes fall into this category. The term `regular' means
that the nodes of the grid are arranged as a regular 3D array, i.e., every
node can be addressed by an index triple (i,j,k). A regular field can be
characterized by three major properties: the coordinate type, the number of
data components, and the primitive component data type (for example
 <tt>short</tt> or <tt>float</tt>).
In the <a class="link" href="HxDev-datahierarchy.html#A1">class hierarchy</a> a major distinction is made
between the number of data components of a field. For example, there is a
class <tt>HxRegScalarField3</tt> representing (one-component) scalar fields
defined on a regular grid. This class is derived from the general base
class <tt>HxScalarField3</tt>. Similar classes exist for (three-component)
vector fields, complex scalar field, and complex vector fields defined 
on regular grids. Fields not falling into one of these categories,
i.e., fields defined on regular grids with a different
number of data components, are represented by the class <tt>HxRegField3</tt> which is directly derived from <tt>HxField3</tt>. Moreover, there
are separate subclasses for the most relevant combinations of the number of
data components and the coordinates type, like <tt>HxStackedScalarField3</tt>
or <tt>HxUniformVectorField3</tt>. All regular data classes provide a member
variable <tt>lattice</tt> of type <tt>HxLattice3</tt>. This variable is an
<em>interface</em>. It can be used to access data fields with a
different number of components in a transparent way.</p>
<p>Below we first discuss the <a class="link" href="HxDev-reglattice.html#A1">lattice interface</a> in
more detail. We then present an overview of all supported
<a class="link" href="HxDev-regcoords.html#A1">coordinate types</a>. Afterwards, two more types of data
fields defined on regular coordinates are discussed, namely
<a class="link" href="HxDev-reglabels.html#A1">label fields</a> and <a class="link" href="HxDev-regcolor.html#A1">color fields</a>.</p>
<p>Note that all these fields can be evaluated without regard to the actual
coordinate type or the primitive data type by means of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s procedural
interface for 3D fields (see <a class="link" href="HxDev-dataeval.html#A1">Section 27.5.1</a>).</p>
