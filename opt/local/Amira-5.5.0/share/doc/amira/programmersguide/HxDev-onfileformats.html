<h2><a name="A1">25.1 On file formats</a></h2>
<p>Before going into detail, let us clarify some general concepts. In <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>,
all data loaded into the system are encapsulated in C++ <em>data classes</em>.
<a class="link" href="HxDev-dataobjs.html#A1">Chapter 27</a> provides more information about the standard
data classes. For example, there is a class to represent tetrahedral grids
(<em>HxTetraGrid</em>), a separate one for scalar fields defined on
tetrahedral grids (<em>HxTetraScalarField</em>), and another one for 3D image
data (<em>HxUniformScalarField3</em>). Every instance of a data class is
represented by a green icon in the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> Pool.
The way in which data are stored in a disk file is called a file format.
Although there is a relationship between data classes and file formats,
these are two different things. It is especially important to understand
that there is no one-to-one correspondence between them.</p>
<p>Typically, a specific data class (like 3D image data) can be stored in many
different file formats (3D TIFF, DICOM, a set of 2D JPEG files, and so
on). On the other hand, a specific file format does not necessarily
correspond to exactly one data class. For example, a data file in Fluent
UNS format can either contain hexahedral grids (<em>HxHexaGrid</em>) or
tetrahedral grids (<em>HxTetraGrid</em>).</p>
<p>Note that there is also no one-to-one correspondence between the instance
of a data class (a green icon in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>) and the instance of a file format
(the actual file). Often multiple files correspond to a single data
object, for example 2D images forming a single 3D image volume. On the
other hand, a single file can contain the data of multiple data objects.
For example, an AVS UCD file can contain a tetrahedral grid as well as
multiple scalar fields defined on it.</p>
<p>Finally, note that information may get lost when saving a data object to a
file in a specific format. For example, when saving a 3D image volume to a
set of 2D JPEG images, the bounding box information will be lost. Likewise,
there are user-defined parameters or attributes in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> that cannot be
encoded in most standard file formats. On the other hand a file reader
often does not interpret all information provided by a specific
file format.</p>
