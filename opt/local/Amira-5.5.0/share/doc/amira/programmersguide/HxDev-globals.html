<h2><a name="A1">30.2 Important Global Objects</a></h2>
<p><a name="A2"></a>
Beside the base classes of modules and data objects, there are some
more classes in the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> kernel that are important to the
developer. Many of these classes have exactly one global instance.
A short summary of these global objects is presented here.
For details, please refer to the online reference documentation by
looking at the file <tt>share/programmersguide/index.html</tt> in the
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> root directory.<b>HxMessage:</b> This class corresponds to the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> console window
in the lower right part of the screen. There is only one global
instance of this class, which can be accessed by <tt>theMsg</tt>. All text
output should go to this object. Text can be printed using the function
<tt>theMsg-&gt;printf("...",...)</tt>, which supports common C-style <tt>printf</tt>
syntax. <tt>HxMessage</tt> also provides static methods for popping up
error and warning messages or simple question dialogs.
<b>HxObjectPool:</b> This class maintains the list of all currently existing
data objects and modules. In the graphical user interface the Pool
is represented by the upper area in the main window containing the
modules' and data objects' icons. There is only one global instance of this
class, which can be accessed by the pointer <tt>theObjectPool</tt>.<b>HxWorkArea:</b> This class displays the ports of selected objects in
the Properties Area and provides the progress bar and busy-state functionality. 
Important
functions are <tt>startWorking</tt>, <tt>stopWorking</tt>, <tt>wasInterrupted</tt> as
well as <tt>busy</tt> and <tt>notBusy</tt>. There is only one global instance of
this class, which can be accessed by the pointer <tt>theWorkArea</tt>. <b>HxFileDialog:</b> This class represents the file browser used for loading 
and saving data. Normally the developer does not need to use this class since
the standard I/O mechanism is completely implemented in the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> kernel. 
However, for special purpose modules, a separate file browser might be
useful. There is a global instance of this class, which can be accessed by
the pointer <tt>theFileDialog</tt>. <b>HxResource:</b> This class maintains the list of all registered file
formats and modules as defined in the package resource files. It also
provides information about the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> root directory, the local <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>
directory, the version number, and so on. Normally there is no need for
the developer to use this class directly. 
There is no instance of this class, since all its
members are static.</p>
<p>
<b>HxViewer:</b> This class represents an <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> 3D viewer. There can be
multiple instances which are accessed via the method <tt>viewer</tt> of the
global object <tt>theController</tt>. Normally you will not not need to use
this class. Instead, you should use the member functions <tt>showGeom</tt> and
<tt>hideGeom</tt> which every module and data object provides in order to display
geometry.<b>HxController:</b> This class controls all 3D viewers and 
Open Inventor geometry. In order to access a viewer you may use the following
statement:
<font size="2"></font></p><pre>
    HxViewer* v0 = theController-&gt;viewer(0,0);
</pre><p><font size="2"></font>
The first argument indicates the ID number of the viewer to be retrieved. In total
there may be up to 16 different viewers. The second argument specifies whether
the viewer should be created or not if it does not already exist.</p>
<p><b>HxColorEditor:</b> <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s color editor. Used, for example, to define the
background color of the viewer. In a standard module you should use
a port such as <tt>HxPortColorList</tt> or <tt>HxPortColorMap</tt> instead of
directly accessing the color editor. There is a global instance of this
class, which can be accessed by the pointer <tt>theColorEditor</tt>.
<b>HxHTML:</b> A window used to display HTML files. This class is used
for <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s online help. The global instance used for displaying the online
user's guide and the online programmer's guide can be accessed by the
pointer <tt>theBrowser</tt>.</p>
<p><b>HxMatDatabase:</b> This class represents <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s global parameter and
material database.
For example, the database contains default colors for
a number of biomedical tissue types such as fat, muscle, and bone.

The database can be accessed by the global pointer <tt>theDatabase</tt>. Details
about the material database are discussed in <a class="link" href="HxDev-dataparam.html#A1">Section 27.5.3</a>.
