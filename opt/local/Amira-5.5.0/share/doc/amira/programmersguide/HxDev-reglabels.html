<h3><a name="A1">27.2.3 Label Fields and the Label Lattice Interface</a></h3>
<p>Label fields are used to store the results of an image segmentation
process. Essentially, at each voxel a number is stored indicating
which material the voxel belongs to. Consequently, label fields
can be considered scalar fields. In fact, currently there are two
different types of label fields, one for uniform coordinates (represented
by class <tt>HxUniformLabelField3</tt> derived from <tt>HxUniformScalarField3</tt>) and one for stacked coordinates (represented by
class <tt>HxStackedLabelField3</tt> derived from class <tt>HxStackedScalarField3</tt>). Since the two types are not derived from a common
base class, a special-purpose interface called <tt>HxLabelLattice3</tt> is
provided. In fact, this interface is in turn derived from <tt>HxLattice3</tt>.
It replaces the standard lattice variable of ordinary regular fields
(see <a class="link" href="HxDev-reglattice.html#A1">Section 27.2.1</a>).The primitive data type of a label field is always <tt>McPrimType::mc_uint8</tt>, i.e., bytes. In addition to the standard lattice
interface, the label lattice interface also provides access to the label
field's materials. Materials are stored in a special parameter subdirectory
of the underlying data object. While discussing the plot API, we already
encountered an example of how to interpret the materials of a label field
(see <a class="link" href="HxDev-plotmodule1.html#A1">Section 26.3.1</a>). Note that whenever a new label is
introduced, a new entry should also be put into the material list. Existing
materials are marked so that they can not be removed from the material list
(this would corrupt the labeling). In order to remove obsolete materials,
call the method <tt>removeEmptyMaterials</tt> of <tt>HxLabelLattice3</tt>.
In addition to the labels, special weights can be stored in
a label lattice. These weights are used to achieve sub-voxel accuracy
when reconstructing 3D surfaces from the segmentation results. A pointer
to the weights can be obtained by calling <tt>getWeights</tt> or <tt>getWeights2</tt> of the label lattice. For more details about <tt>HxLabelLattice3</tt>, please refer to the online class documentation.</p>
