<h3><a name="A1">27.1.2 Remarks About the Class Hierarchy</a></h3>
<p>All data classes are derived from the base class <tt>HxData</tt>. This
class in turn is derived from <tt>HxObject</tt>, the base class of all
objects that can be put into the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> Pool. The class <tt>HxData</tt>
adds support for reading and writing data objects, and it provides
the variable <tt>parameters</tt> of type <tt>HxParamBundle</tt>. This variable
can be used to annotate a data object by an arbitrary number of nested
parameters. The parameters of any data object can be edited interactively
using the parameter editor described in the User's Guide.
We observe that the majority of data classes are derived from <tt>HxSpatialData</tt>. This is the base class of all data objects which are
embedded in 3D space as opposed for example to colormaps.
<tt>HxSpatialData</tt> adds support for user-defined affine transformations,
i.e., translations, rotations, and scaling. For details refer to
<a class="link" href="HxDev-dataxform.html#A1">Section 27.5.2</a>. It also provides the virtual
method <tt>getBoundingBox</tt> which is redefined by all derived classes.
Two important child classes of <tt>HxSpatialData</tt> are <tt>HxField3</tt> and 
<tt>HxVertexSet</tt>.
<tt>HxVertexSet</tt> is the base class of all data objects that are defined on
an unstructured set of vertices in 3D space, like surfaces or tetrahedral
grids. The class provides methods to apply a user-defined affine transformation
to all vertices of the object, or modify the point coordinates in some
other way.</p>
<p><tt>HxField3</tt> is the base class of data fields defined on a 3D-domain, like
3D scalar fields or 3D vector fields. <tt>HxField3</tt> defines an efficient
procedural interface to evaluate the field at an arbitrary 3D point within
the domain, independent of whether the latter is a regular grid, a
tetrahedral grid, or something else. The procedural interface is described
in more detail in <a class="link" href="HxDev-dataeval.html#A1">Section 27.5.1</a>.
Looking at the inheritance hierarchy again, we observe that a high level
distinction is made between fields returning a different number of data
values. For example, all 3D scalar fields are derived from a common base
class <tt>HxScalarField3</tt>, and all 3D vector fields are derived from a
common base class <tt>HxVectorField3</tt>. The reason for this structure is
that many modules depend on the data dimensionality of a field only,
not on the internal representation of the data. For example, a module for
visualizing a flow field by means of particle tracing can be written to
accept any object of type <tt>HxVectorField3</tt> as input. It then
automatically operates on all derived vector fields, regardless of the
type of grid they are defined on.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is often useful to treat the number of data
variables of a field as a dynamic quantity and to distinguish between
the type of grid a field is defined on. For example, we may wish to
have a common base class of fields defined on a regular grid and derived
classes for regular scalar or vector fields. Since this structure and the
one sketched above are very hard to incorporate into a common class graph,
even if multiple inheritance were used, another concept has been chosen
in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>, namely <em>interfaces</em>. Interfaces were first introduced by the
Java programming language. They allow the programmer to take advantage
of common properties of classes that are not related by inheritance.
In <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> interfaces can be implemented as class members, or as additional
base classes. In the first case a data class <em>contains</em> an interface
class, while in the second case it is <em>derived</em> from <tt>HxInterface</tt>.
Important interface classes are <tt>HxLattice3</tt>, <tt>HxTetraData</tt>, and
<tt>HxHexaData</tt>, which are members of fields defined on regular,
tetrahedral, and hexahedral grids, respectively. Another example is <tt>HxLabelLattice3</tt>, which is a member of <tt>HxUniformLabelField3</tt>, as well
as <tt>HxStackedLabelField3</tt>. In <a class="link" href="HxDev-plotmodule1.html#A1">Section 26.3.1</a> we have
already presented an example of how to use this interface in order to write
a module which operates on any label field, regardless of the actual
coordinate type.</p>
