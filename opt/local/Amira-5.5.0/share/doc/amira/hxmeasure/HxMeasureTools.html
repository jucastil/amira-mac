<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This module provides access to two-dimensional and three-dimensional measuring tools. 
The idea is to click directly into the rendered scene and draw. The 2D tools draw 
anywhere in the viewer window, whereas the 3D tools work only on geometry displayed 
in the viewer.</p>
<p>You can access the tools via the <em>View/Measuring</em> menu or via the
measuring tool button at the top of the viewer. Click on the tiny
triangle at the lower right corner of the tool icon to display a
pulldown menu from which you can select the desired measuring tool: 
(2D or 3D length, 2D or 3D angle, and 2D or 3D annotation).

To change the position of a selected tool, click on one of its red handles and
drag it to a new location.
Some tools also provide text entries that allow changing their position.</p>
<p>Once the <em>Measurement</em> tool is activated, the mouse pointer changes its shape. 
While the tool is activated, every measurement you perform will be automatically added to the list.
For example, you can activate the 2D Length tool to measure a distance, measure a second one, then 
activate the 2D Angle tool and add an angle measurement. The three measurement objects 
will be added to the list one by one automatically.</p>
<p>Every tool has attributes (visible, locked, render in front, text,
color, line width, and font size) that are accessible via the <em>Tools</em> port 
of the <em>Measurement</em> object which was created in the Pool.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> 2D distance measurements require orthographic view and the measurement is in pixels.</p>

<div class="portsnapshot"><img src="HxMeasureTools_tools.png" /><br /></div>
<div class="body"><p>Each tool is displayed as a row in the toolbox. 
The columns have the following meaning (from left to right):
</p>
<ul><li><em>visible</em>: Click on the eye icon to toggle visibility
 of the tool in the viewer. When the eye is empty, the
 tool is invisible.
 Click and drag over multiple rows to toggle the visibility 
 of multiple tools.</li><li><em>locked</em>: Click on the padlock icon to lock/unlock
 the tool. When the padlock is locked, the tool is locked
 and can't be modified in the viewer.
 Click and drag over multiple rows to lock/unlock multiple tools.</li><li><em>render in front</em>: Click on the render-in-front icon to 
 toggle whether the tool is always rendered in
 front of the scene and no longer hidden by objects that
 are nearer to the camera. It also is always pickable.
 Click and drag over multiple rows to change the icon for 
 multiple tools.</li><li><em>type</em>: The fourth column indicates the type of the tool (2D length, etc.).</li><li><em>text</em>: The fifth column displays the value of the measured quantity.
 Double clicking on it allows you to change the display format for 
 numerical values, and the text string for text tools.</li>
</ul><p>
If you select a tool in the toolbox, it is highlighted in the viewer 
with red squares (handles) that you can drag using the mouse. You can select more than one tool
at the same time. 
With the color button, the line width dropdown menu and spin box, and the font size spin box,
you can change the appearance of the selected tools. The line width 
affects the size the of red tool handles as well.</p>
<p>
With the <em>Export</em> button you can export all containing Measurement tools information to a <a class="link" href="../hxstatistics/HxSpreadSheet.html#A1">SpreadSheet</a>.</p>
<p>With the <em>Delete</em> button you can delete the currently selected tool(s).
