<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
 The <em>CameraPath Editor</em> allows you to edit camera paths defined
 by a number of keyframes. To get started, choose <em>CameraPath</em>
 from the <em>Create</em> menu and click on the Camera Path Editor button of the new
 camera path object. The editor will appear and automatically open an
 additional viewer.</p>

<div class="caption">
<b>Figure 1:</b>
Control panel of the camera path editor. The arrow shaped
 control buttons can be used to play forward and backward, to jump from
 keyframe to keyframe, or to step frame by frame. When the editor is off,
 the camera path provides a time port.</div>

 
 </div>
<p> The original viewer (viewer 0) is the camera view, i.e., it shows the
 same as if you were looking through the camera, while the additional
 viewer will show you all of the keyframe cameras from a bird's eye view.
 In order to start your camera path, choose an appropriate view in the
 original viewer (see <a class="link" href="../usersguide/viewer.html#A1">Section 3.1.8 (Viewer Window)</a> to
 learn how to do that) and click on the <em>add</em> button.
 
 Your first
 keyframe has been saved. The time slider should contain one red line
 and it should have advanced to 10. Now change the view in the original
 viewer and click on add again. A second keyframe appears and so on.</p>

<div class="caption">
<b>Figure 2:</b>
The camera path is shown in an extra viewer. You can click on
 a keyframe and modify the camera. The changes will be displayed in the
 original viewer simultaneously. The reddish icon represents the current
 camera. In general this is not a keyframe but an interpolated camera.</div>

 
	</div>
<p> Once you have played your camera path using the play button, you may
 continue adding keyframes by simply typing the time for the new
 keyframe into the text field or by moving the slider and then clicking
 <em>add</em>. Note: The original view will not be changed when the
 slider is moved or the text in the text field is changed.</p>
<p> To change the time of a keyframe, jump to this frame, click on
 <em>remove</em>, type in the new time, and click on <em>add</em> again.</p>
<p> If you want to have a constant camera velocity on its path, press the
 <em>const velocity</em> button. Depending on the distances between the
 camera positions
 at the keyframes, the keyframe times are changed to be
 equidistant between camera positions.</p>
<p> <b>Caution:</b> Pressing the <em>circular path</em> button will create a
 new camera path and destroy the old one. The new camera path lies on a
 circle around one of the major axes with the center at the point the
 camera in the original window is looking at. The radius is determined
 by the distance of the camera position and the point the camera looks at.</p>
