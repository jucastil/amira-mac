<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The surface editor allows you to modify a triangular surface
in several ways, e.g., to remove or refine triangles, to flip edges
or move points, or to set boundary ids for individual triangles. It
also allows you to check a surface for intersecting triangles or for
falsely oriented patches.</p>
<p>To open a surface editor, in the Pool select the surface object to edit, 
then click on the Surface Editor button in the Properties
Area. 
The surface editor places
its GUI controls directly into the main 3D viewer window. This makes
interactive surface editing very comfortable. In particular, the
editor adds a <em>Surface</em> menu to the main menu bar,
as well as a toolbar. The
user interface of the editor is depicted in <a class="link" href="#A2">Figure 1</a>.
To close a surface editor, click again on the surface editor button
in the Properties Area. 
Note that only one surface editor can be active at a time.
Activating a second editor causes the first one to be closed. </p>
<p>To save your work, you can use the following entries of the <em>File</em>
menu:</p>

<ul><li><em>Save</em>: Saves the surface under the same file name as it has been
 saved under before. This option allows you to quickly save intermediate
 results during complex edit tasks.</li><li><em>Save As...</em>: Pops up the file dialog and saves the surface under
 a user-chosen file name.</li>
</ul>

<p>The surface editor works in conjunction with a
<a class="link" href="../hxsurftools/HxDisplaySurface.html#A1">SurfaceView</a> module. If such a module is
not already connected to the surface, an instance of it will be
created automatically when the editor is activated. However, most
settings of the <em>SurfaceView</em> module can be controlled directly
via menu entries of the editor itself. Therefore there is no need
to have the <em>SurfaceView</em> module permanently selected.</p>
<p>A basic concept of the surface editor are the notions of <em>visible</em> and <em>highlighted triangles</em> respectively. Highlighted
triangles are drawn in red wireframe. Many tools operate not on the
surface as a whole, but only on highlighted triangles. For example,
if you want to refine parts of the surface, you'll first have to
highlight the involved triangles before choosing <em>Refine faces</em>
from the <em>Surface/Edit</em> menu. Besides the highlight buffer, there is
another buffer determining which triangles will actually be drawn.
This allows you to cut away parts of a complex surface. Highlighted
triangles can be added to the visible buffer or removed from it,
just as in an ordinary <em>SurfaceView</em> module. Note that hiding
a triangle doesn't mean to delete it.</p>
<p>Triangles can be highlighted in a number of ways. On the one hand, there are
interactive <em>tools</em> allowing you to select triangles using some kind of
mouse interaction. For example, triangles can be picked individually or a
contour can be drawn in the 3D viewer. Buttons representing the different
mouse tools are listed in a tool bar. Clicking on a button causes the
corresponding tool to be activated. On the other hand, triangles can be
highlighted using automatic <em>selectors</em>. Selectors are listed in the
leftmost combo box of the surface editor's selector tool bar. There are
selectors for highlighting triangles depending on their inner and outer
region, for highlighting triangles with a certain boundary id or belonging
to certain patch, and many more.</p>
<p>In the following different elements of the surface editor will be described
in detail, namely</p>
