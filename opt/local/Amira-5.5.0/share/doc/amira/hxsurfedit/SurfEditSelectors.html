<h3><a name="A1">Selectors</a></h3>
<p>This section describes tools for automatically highlighting certain parts
of the surface. The selectors are listed in a combo box on the very left just
beneath the main toolbar. Most selectors provide some additional controls
which are displayed right beside this combo box.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><em>Materials</em>: Just as in a <a class="link" href="../hxsurftools/HxDisplaySurface.html#A1">SurfaceView</a>
 module, this selector allows you to highlight parts of the surface
 separating two particular regions from each other. The two regions
 are specified in two additional combo boxes which are shown once
 the selector is activated.
 <br />
</li><li><em>Boundary ids</em>: Highlights all triangles with a particular
 boundary id. The boundary ids defined in the surface are listed in a
 separate combo box. Boundary ids can be modified using the <em>Set
 boundary ids...</em> option of the <em>Surface/Edit</em> menu.
 <br />
</li><li><em>Patches</em>: Highlights all triangles belonging to a particular
 patch of the surface. The different patches can be selected using
 a slider displayed right beside the selector combo box. A patch is
 a group of triangles separating the same two regions and having the
 same boundary id.
 <br />
</li><li><em>Intersection test</em>: Performs an intersection test and highlights
 intersecting triangles. The <em>compute</em> button actually initiates
 the test, while the <em>back</em> and <em>forward</em> buttons allow you to
 cycle through the list of intersecting faces. The total number of
 intersections is printed in the console window. Intersections can be
 repaired automatically using the <em>Fix intersections</em> tool from the
 <em>Surface/Edit</em> menu, or manually using the edit tools described 
 <a class="link" href="SurfEditTools.html#A1">below</a> (edge flip, edge collapse, edge bisection, 
 vertex movement).
 <br />
</li><li><em>Orientation test</em>: Performs an orientation test and highlights
 falsely oriented triangles. You should have removed all intersections
 before applying this check. For simple configurations the wrong
 triangles are removed automatically. The number of inconsistently
 oriented triangles and the number of removed triangles are printed in the
 console window. If the automatic method could not remove all incorrect
 orientations, you can proceed as in the case of intersections and try
 to repair them manually. <b>Important:</b> A prerequisite for the
 orientation test is that the outer triangles of the surface be
 assigned to material <em>Exterior</em>. If the surface does not contain
 such a material or if the assignment to <em>Exterior</em> is not correct,
 the test will falsely report orientation errors.
 <br />
</li><li><em>Aspect Ratio</em>, <em>Dihedral Angle</em>, and <em>Tetra Quality</em>
 sort all surface triangles according to different quality measures.
 The <em>aspect ratio</em> is the ratio of the radii of the circumcircle and the
 incircle of a triangle. The largest aspect ratio should be
 below 20 (better 10). The <em>dihedral angle</em> is the angle between two
 adjacent triangles at their common edge. The smallest dihedral angle
 should be above 5 degrees (better 10). <em>Tetra quality</em> may be
 useful if you want to create a tetrahedral volume mesh from the
 surface. For each surface triangle the aspect ratios of the tetrahedra
 which will probably be created for that triangle are calculated. The
 largest tetrahedral aspect ratio should be below 50 (better 25). The 
 worst triangle according to the selected quality measure is
 displayed, and the worst quality is printed in the console window.
 Using the <em>back</em> and <em>forward</em> buttons right beside the
 selector combo box you can cycle through all other triangles and edit
 the surface if necessary. In the <em>Surface/Edit</em> menu, there are 
 automatic tools for improving all of the quality measures: 
 <em>Flip edges</em> for the triangle aspect ratio, 
 <em>Fix small dihedral angles</em> for the dihedral angle, and 
 <em>Fix tetra quality</em> for the tetrahedron quality.
 <br />
</li><li><em>Non-manifold test</em>: This test detects non-manifolds on surfaces 
 and displays every non-manifold location including the incident triangles.
 <br />
</li><li><em>Holes test</em>: This test detects holes on triangular meshes, which
 can be closed by the triangulators available from the
 <a class="link" href="SurfEditMenu.html#A1">Fill Hole...</a> menu entry. 
 </li>
</ul><p>
