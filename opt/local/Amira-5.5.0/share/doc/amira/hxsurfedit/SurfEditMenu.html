<h3><a name="A1">Menu Entries</a></h3>
<p>The surface editor's <em>Surface</em> menu is is displayed inside the 3D viewer 
window while the editor is active. Four submenus
are accessible from this menu: <em>Edit</em>, <em>View</em>, <em>Buffer</em>, and <em>Tests</em>.
Each of these is described separately below. </p>
<p>













</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="A2">Edit Menu</a></h4>
<p></p>
<ul><li><em>Undo</em>: Undoes the last edit operation (edge flip, edge collapse,
 edge bisection, vertex movement). Selection and highlight changes can
 be undone as well. The size of the undo buffer is limited to 100
 entries.</li><li><em>Delete highlighted faces</em>: Permanently removes the highlighted
 triangles from the surface.</li><li><em>Remove coplanar faces</em>: Permanently removes coplanar triangles,
 i.e., triangles with the same three vertices, from the surface. The
 inner region and outer region id of the remaining triangle is updated
 appropriately.</li><li><em>Recompute connectivity</em>: Recomputes the surface's connectivity
 information, i.e., contours and branching points. Connectivity
 information is optional. If it is present, contours can be displayed
 using the <a class="link" href="../hxsurftools/HxDisplayContours.html#A1">ContourView</a> module. In addition,
 <em>recompute connectivity</em> causes unused points of the surface to
 be deleted.</li><li><em>Refine faces</em>: Subdivides all highlighted triangles by bisecting
 their edges. Each refined triangle is replaced by four new ones. In
 addition, adjacent non-highlighted triangles are split in two in order
 to avoid dangling nodes.</li><li><em>Smooth faces</em>: Smoothes all highlighted triangles by shifting 
 their vertices. Each vertex is shifted towards the average position of 
 its neighbors. Special care is taken in the case of boundary vertices, 
 for which not all the neighbors are considered, but only those that 
 are also on the boundary. In this way sharp boundaries are preserved.</li><li><em>Flip edges...</em>: Pops up a dialog allowing you to flip certain
 edges inside the highlighted part of the surface. The edge flips are
 performed in order to improve the aspect ratio of the involved
 triangles. An edge flip is only attempted if the aspect ratio of one
 of the two involved triangles is worse than a user-specified value,
 and the crease angle between them is below a user-defined threshold.</li><li><em>Reorder patches...</em>: Pops up a dialog allowing you to rearrange
 the internal order of the surface patches. Two different patches can be
 selected and then swapped. This operation is useful for certain
 applications where two different surfaces are required to have the 
 same patch structure.</li><li><em>Set boundary ids...</em>: Pops up a dialog allowing you to edit the
 surface's boundary ids. The dialog permits you to define new boundary
 ids or to change existing ones (including the preferred colors).
 Highlighted triangles can be assigned a new boundary id using the
 dialog's <em>set</em> button.
</li><li><em>Fix intersections...</em>: Pops up a dialog for an automatic repair
 of intersecting triangles. The total number and the number of fixed 
 intersections will be shown in the console window.</li><li><em>Fix small dihedral angles...</em>: Pops up a dialog for an automatic
 repair of small dihedral angles. The dialog offers two different
 repair modes: vertex smoothing, and a combination of edge flips and
 vertex shifts. The dialog lets you define a lower bound for the
 dihedral angle.</li><li><em>Fix tetra quality...</em>: This tool provides an automatic repair 
 of configurations which might induce large tetrahedron aspect ratios. 
 It pops up a dialog where you can specify an upper bound and an 
 attempted value for the tetrahedron aspect ratio.</li><li><em>Prepare Tetragen...</em>: This tool may be useful if you want to 
 create a tetrahedral volume mesh from the surface. It combines the
 <em>Flip edges</em>, <em>Fix small dihedral angles</em>, and <em>Fix tetra 
 quality</em> tools. You can specify a lower bound and an attempted value 
 for the tetrahedron aspect ratio.</li><li><em>Fill Hole...</em>: This menu entry shows a drop down menu in the 
 properties panel with a selection of hole fill algorithms. 
 By pressing the fill button the currently displayed hole 
 is triangulated using the selected hole fill algorithm. 
 </li><li><em>Magic wand settings...</em>: This menu entry pops up a dialog
 alowing you to change parameters of the <a class="link" href="SurfEditTools.html#A1">magic
 wand tool</a>. Details for that are described below.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="A3">View Menu</a></h4>
<p>This menu allows you to change certain settings of the
<a class="link" href="../hxsurftools/HxDisplaySurface.html#A1">SurfaceView</a> module used by the surface editor.
The settings affect the draw style and the color mode used for rendering
the surface. Possible draw styles are <em>outlined</em>, <em>shaded</em>, <em>lines</em>, <em>points</em>, and <em>transparent</em>. Possible color modes are
<em>normal</em>, <em>mixed</em>, <em>twisted</em>, and <em>boundary ids</em>. In the
first three modes colors are chosen according to the material ids assigned
to the surface's patches. In the last mode colors are chosen according to
the triangles' boundary ids.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="A4">Buffer Menu</a></h4>
<p>This menu contains several entries for modifying the editor's highlight
and view buffers. The buffers determine whether a triangle is highlighted
or whether it is visible in a normal fashion. Both buffers are independent
from each other. They can be stored in an internal backup buffer
using the menu entries <em>copy highlights</em> and <em>copy buffer</em>
respectively. Once one of the buffers has been copied it can be
restored using <em>paste highlights</em> or <em>paste buffer</em>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="A5">Tests Menu</a></h4>
<p>This menu lists certain test operations which can be performed in order
to check the quality and consistency of the surface. Internally, the tests
are considered as <em>selectors</em> because they cause certain triangles of
the surface to be highlighted. Therefore, the test are described in detail
in the <a class="link" href="SurfEditSelectors.html#A1">selectors section</a>.</p>
