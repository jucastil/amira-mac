<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This editor allows creating and editing <a class="link" href="../hxsurfacepath/HxSurfacePathSet.html#A1">paths</a> on
 triangular surfaces. Surface paths can currently be used only to measure 
 distances on surfaces. To do so, right-click the surface object and
 select <em>CreateSurfacePath</em> from the -&gt;<em>Measure</em> sub-menu. This 
 creates a new <a class="link" href="../hxsurfacepath/HxSurfacePathSet.html#A1">SurfacePathSet</a> and automatically 
 opens the <em>Surface Path Editor</em>.

 Note that the following operations can only be applied, if the
 editor is selected in the <em>Pool</em>. In this way, you may interact with the 
 surface in the usual manner when deselecting the editor.</p>
<p> The basic operations are:
 </p>
<ul><li><b>Creating a path</b>: Press Shift and left-click on the
 surface. A path can only be created if no other path is selected.
 Paths can be deselected by left-clicking onto the surface.</li><li><b>Adding a node to a selected path</b>: Press Shift and
 left-click on the surface. A node can only be added to a path if
 it is the only selected path. The node will always be added
 after the last added node.</li><li><b>Inserting a node into a selected path</b>: Press
 'I' and left-click on the path at the point where you
 want to insert the node. The path must be the only selected
 path.</li><li><b>Selecting a path</b>: Left-click on the path.</li><li><b>Selecting a node</b>: Left-click on the node. A path
 must be selected to select one of its nodes.</li><li><b>Selecting more than one path</b>: Press 'S' and
 left-click on the next path you also want to select.</li><li><b>Deselecting a selected path</b>: Press 'S' and
 left-click on the path.</li><li><b>Moving a selected node</b>: Press Shift and left-click on
 the point of the surface you want to move the node to.</li><li><b>Delete selected items </b>: Press 'D' or the Delete
 button. If a node is
 selected, it will be deleted. Else all selected paths will be
 deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a <em>SurfacePathSet</em> with one or more surface paths has been created
 their length can be queried by selecting a path and read its length from 
 port <em>Info</em>. If multiple paths are to be measured at once the 
 <em>SurfacePathSet</em> can be converted to a <a class="link" href="../hxspatialgraph/HxSpatialGraph.html#A1">SpatialGraph</a> 
 object using <em>Compute</em>-&gt;<a class="link" href="../hxspatialgraph/CastHxLineSetToHxSpatialGraph.html#A1">LineSetToSpatialGraph</a>
 and then analyzed using a <a class="link" href="../hxspatialgraph/HxSpatialGraphStats.html#A1">SpatialGraphStatistics</a>
 module.

<div class="portsnapshot"><img src="HxSurfacePathSet_connector.png" /><br /></div>
<div class="body"><p>Select a strategy to connect two points. Several different
 connectors exist. Choose one from the list below.
 </p>
<ul><li><b>Dijkstra</b>: connects two nodes using nodes computed
 with Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. The path will therefore
 only cover edges and vertices of the surface. Note that if a
 surface scalar field is connected to the surface, the Dijkstra
 connector will use the edge weights provided by this scalar
 field instead of the edge lengths.</li><li><b>TriangleDijkstra</b>: connects two nodes using nodes
 computed with Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. In contrast to
 the <em>Dijkstra</em> connector, the intermediate nodes generated
 by this connector lie in the middle of the surface edges. The
 segments cross the triangles, hence the name <em>TriangleDijkstra</em>.</li><li><b>PlaneCut</b>: uses the two triangle normals of the points
 that are to be connected to compute a plane. This plane is
 intersected with the surface and the shortest connection of the
 points within this intersection is taken as path. The plane is
 chosen such that the angle between the two surface normals and
 the plane are equal.</li><li><b>Geodesic</b>: computes the shortest geodesic path
 between two points. The used algorithm is extremely slow. If
 time restrictions are not critical, prefer this geodesic
 connector, otherwise try one of the following three connectors.</li><li><b>P2PGeodesic</b>: like Geodesic but runs a little faster.</li><li><b>ApproxGeodesic</b>: an approximation of the
 Geodesic algorithm that runs a lot faster.</li><li><b>LocallyShortest</b>: computes a geodesic between the two
 points. However, it might not be the shortest one, but only the
 locally shortest one.</li><li><b>NonManifold</b>: computes path along non-manifold edges
 of surface. A path can only be computed if the control points
 belong to the same non-manifold.

<div class="body"><p><b>Close</b>: Connects the start and end node of the active
 path. As there is no last node, nodes cannot be appended to a
 closed path.<br />

 <b>Open</b>: If the selected path is closed it is either
 opened on the selected node or, if no node is selected, it is
 opened at the node that was the last node before the path was
 closed. If the selected path is already open and a node in this
 path is selected, the path is split in two at this node.<br />

 <b>Reverse</b>: Reverses the active path. After reversing a path,
 new nodes will be appended at the beginning and not at the
 end of the reversed path.</p>

<div class="body"><p><b>Merge</b>: Merge tries to connect endpoints of selected paths
 and make them one path.<br />

 <b>Entangle</b>: Computes a node for each point of intersection of
 line segments in the path set. If two nodes of the paths are
 similar or equal in coordinate and type, they are replaced by a
 single node. Entangled nodes can be moved like normal nodes, but
 when moving them, all paths that belong to it are changed as well.<br />

 <b>Untangle</b>: Opposite to <em>Entangle</em>. If a node occurs in more
 than one path it is duplicated once for each path.<br />

 <b>Split at Intersections</b>: If two paths not only intersect in
 one point, but in a line segment, fix removes the overlapping part
 of one of the paths and splits them into two at these points. In
 the resulting path set, all paths only intersect in points.</p>

 applied directly. Using the <em>Snap to edges</em> button, the user
 can convert the path into a vertex path for which patchification
 can be applied.

<div class="body"><p><b>Smooth path</b>:
 This option smooths a path, whereby the end nodes will be fixed.<br />

 <b>Snap path to edges</b>:
 Snap transforms nodes that are near another node type, i.e. edge
 or vertex, into this type. If, for example, a triangle-node is
 very close to an edge, then it is moved to the closest point on
 the edge and becomes an edge-node. Here, very close means, the
 difference of the coordinates of the nodes is smaller than <em>epsilon</em>, where the epsilon can be defined using the <em>Snap
 epsilon</em> port. A triangle-node can become an edge or vertex
 node and an edge-node can become a vertex-node but not vice versa.
 Snapping paths to vertex nodes is necessary to directly allow
 patchification of the surface using the surface path.</p>
