<h3><a name="A1">Image Viewer</a></h3>
<p>The <em>Image Viewer</em> represents the main part of the align tool. It
allows you to align the slices manually using the mouse and/or
the keyboard. While two slices are displayed simultaneously, only one slice
can be edited at a time.</p>
<p>A slice can be translated over the other by keeping the left mouse button
pressed and dragging the slice. Also, the slice can be moved using the
cursor keys (see <a class="link" href="HxAlignSlices_keybindings.html#A2">Key Bindings</a> section).
The rotation can be obtained by dragging the slice while keeping the middle mouse
button pressed. All rotations are made around the middle of the slice.</p>
<p>If the <a class="link" href="HxAlignSlices_menubar.html#A6">Transform all</a> option is ON (<a class="link" href="HxAlignSlices_menubar.html#A5">Options</a>
menu), the actual alignment will be preserved for all pairs of two
consecutive slices (except the slices actually edited).</p>
<p>The <em>Image Viewer</em> allows you to edit the landmarks.
In order to edit the landmarks, the <a class="link" href="HxAlignSlices_toolbar.html#A4">Edit landmarks</a>
mode must be set.</p>
<p>A landmark can be <b>selected</b> by clicking inside the triangle that
represents the landmark. Once selected, a landmark can be moved, removed or
deselected. The landmarks can be also selected consecutively, by clicking
anywhere on the slice (not on a landmark). After a so-selected landmark has
been moved, the next landmark in the list can be selected in the same way.</p>
<p>In order to <b>move</b> a selected landmark, just click on the new position.</p>
<p>A selected landmark can be <b>removed</b> by choosing the <em>Remove</em> item of
the <a class="link" href="HxAlignSlices_menubar.html#A17">Landmarks</a> menu or pressing the <b>Del</b> key. A
landmark can be removed only if the number of landmarks defined for each
slice is greater than 2. The corresponding landmark will be removed from
each slice so that the number of landmarks is the same for each slice.</p>
<p>You can create a <b>new</b> landmark using the <em>Landmark/Add</em> menu or
pressing the <b>Ins</b> key and clicking on the desired position. A new
landmark will be created for each slice.The creation of a new landmark can
be canceled by pressing <b>Esc</b>. </p>
