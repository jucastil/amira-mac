<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This module calculates the area of the individual patches of a surface
(<em>patch mode</em>). The results are stored in a
<a class="link" href="HxSpreadSheet.html#A1">spread sheet</a> data object.</p>
<p>In an alternative mode the area and the enclosed volume of the different
regions defined in the surface are computed (<em>material mode</em>). In this
mode the total surface area is twice as large since every triangle
contributes to two regions. Note that for this mode it is required that
the surface be closed, i.e., that all regions are completely enclosed by
triangles. Otherwise, the computed volumes will be incorrect.</p>
<p>Actually, the volume computation simply sums the signed volumes of all of
the tetrahedra joining surface triangles to the origin (point with
coordinates x=0, y=0, z=0). The sign of the volumes depends on triangle
orientation relative to the origin, so volumes are computed correctly even
for non convex surfaces. In the case of a closed surface, the result is the
volume of the enclosed surface. If the surface is not closed, then the
result can be considered as the volume comprised between the surface
(triangles) and the origin, which can be still useful depending on your
purpose.</p>
<p>Press the <em>Apply</em> button to start the computation.</p>

<p>In <em>material mode</em> the resulting spread sheet object contains one row
for every non-empty region of the surface. Each row contains the name of
the region, the number of triangles of the region's boundary, the surface
area of the boundary, as well as the enclosed volume. Usually, for the <em>exterior</em> region the volume is negative.</p>
<p>In <em>patch mode</em> the resulting spread sheet object contains one row for
every patch of the surface. Each row contains the patch id, the patch's
inner region name, the patch's outer region name, the number of triangles
of the patch, and the surface area of the patch. In the following columns the
total number of triangles and the total surface area are printed. If the
surface data structure also contains the surface contour, the surface
perimeter is displayed. Note that you might have to use the
<b>recompute</b> command of the <a class="link" href="../hxsurface/HxSurface.html#A1">Surface</a> module,
to obtain the contour information.</p>
