</div><p>
The Filament Editor is activated by pressing the <em>Filament Editor</em> button in the 
sub-application taskbar. This will change the layout of the main and viewer 
window as shown in <a class="link" href="#A2">Figure 1</a>. The main components of this layout 
are the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><b>Data Selector</b>: In the upper part of the main window two drop-down menus 
allow you to select the image and <a class="link" href="../hxspatialgraph/HxSpatialGraph.html#A1">SpatialGraph</a> data objects to be edited. Data have to be 
loaded into the Amira workspace before they will be available in the <em>Image Data</em> 
and <em>Graph Data</em> drop-down menus.</li><li><b>2D Viewer Settings</b>: Controls for window level and thickness settings in 
2D slice and 2D segment viewer. It also provides buttons to turn on/off volume rendering and/or
slicing in the 3D viewer. When volume rendering is activated, the transparency can 
be changed using the <em>Alpha</em> slider.</li><li><b>Label Window</b>: The major part of the main control panel is occupied by the 
label window presenting a tree-like representation of the graph. Here the user 
may define and edit an arbitrary number of labels on different hierarchical levels
 of the graph data. Use the right mouse button to add, remove, and rename the labels.</li><li><b>Tool Box</b>: Below the label window a tool box provides access for the tracing 
tools and the graph display options. Depending on the currently selected tool, the 
area below the tool bar will show additional controls.</li><li><b>Info Area</b>: At the bottom of the control panel a box informs the user about 
the graph being edited. The information shown are the total number of node/segments
and the number of selected nodes/segments.</li><li><b>Viewers</b>: The Filament Editor typically offers three viewers for editing and
viewing the data: The 2D slice viewer displays the image data as an arbitrarily
oriented slice with variable thickness. In contrast the 2D segment viewer displays
the image data along the currently selected segment as a curved slice also with
variable thickness.
The 3D viewer is an instance of the familiar Amira viewer for 3D visualization
of the graph data with optional 3D slice and volume rendering display.</li>
