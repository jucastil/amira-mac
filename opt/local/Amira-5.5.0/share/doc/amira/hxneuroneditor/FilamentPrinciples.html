<h3><a name="A1">Basic principles and terminology</a></h3>
<p>Analyzing images of filamentous networks consists of extracting their skeleton in 
terms of line segments connected by nodes. Amira can store such data in a 
dedicated data type called <a class="link" href="../hxspatialgraph/HxSpatialGraph.html#A1">SpatialGraph</a>. 
A <a class="link" href="../hxspatialgraph/HxSpatialGraph.html#A1">SpatialGraph</a> object consists of <b>nodes</b> 
and <b>segments</b> where nodes are the branching points and endpoints, and segments are 
the lines connecting the nodes. Segments, in turn consist of <b>points</b> describing 
the three-dimensional course of a segment. A set of segments connected by nodes 
will be termed a <b>graph</b>. A <a class="link" href="../hxspatialgraph/HxSpatialGraph.html#A1">SpatialGraph</a> data object can 
store several graphs. Furthermore, <em>SpatialGraph</em> objects can hold scalar and 
label data on different levels. 
On the point level scalar data such as the thickness of the fiber can be stored. 
On the segment, node and graph levels also labels can be defined. Labels are useful
to annotate the graph according to topological, structural, and/or functional
properties.</p>
<p>The Filament Editor provides automatic and interactive tools to extract the graph 
data from an image stack. The automatic tool (<em>Auto Skeleton</em>) takes segmented 
image stacks (i.e., label fields) as input and extracts the desired centerline using 
sophisticated thinning algorithms. Segmentation is either done by thresholding the 
image on the fly using the <em>Window Level</em> setting for the 2D slice viewer directly 
within the Filament Editor, or can be done using thresholding modules 
(Compute-&gt; <a class="link" href="../hxlattice/HxLabelVoxel.html#A1">LabelVoxel</a>) or the <a class="link" href="HxGI.html">Segmentation Editor</a>. 
Automatically extracted graphs can then be post-processed using interactive tracing 
and/or line editing tools. In interactive tracing the user sets key points in the 
2D slice viewer along a fiber and the tool finds the centerline connecting 
both points automatically.</p>
<p>When topology and geometry of the graph have been determined it can be labelled according 
to user specifications. An arbitrary number of labels can be inserted at the graph, 
node, and segment level. Each graph, node, or segment can belong to multiple label groups. 
This can be useful for visualization of complex fiber networks.
