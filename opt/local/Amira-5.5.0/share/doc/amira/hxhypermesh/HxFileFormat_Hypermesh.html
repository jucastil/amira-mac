<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <em>Hypermesh (TM)</em> file format is used by the <em>Altair HyperWorks</em>
product family. The format describes 3D geometries consisting of 3D
vertices and a number of cells based on them. <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> can only read <em>Hypermesh</em> files in plain ASCII format containing 3D triangular surfaces,
tetrahedral grids, or so-called <em>tria6</em> components (a special kind of
triangles). If tetrahedral components are present, the result of the import
is a TetraGrid, otherwise it is a 3D surface.</p>
<p>Tetrahedral grids and 3D surfaces can also be exported in <em>Hypermesh</em>
format. Every 3D surface component (patch) is saved with its
interior-exterior material names, separated by a "-". However, it is not
guaranteed that other applications understand this coding. A tetrahedral
grid is saved together with its boundary surface. The patch structure of
the boundary surface is retained. In order to separate the boundary into
different patches, the boundary condition ids are interpreted. The material
ids of every tetrahedron are also saved. </p>
<p><font face="helvetica">Amira</font> identifies <em>Hypermesh</em> files by the extensions <tt>.hm</tt>
or <tt>.hmascii</tt>. The decision whether the file contains a 3D surface or a
tetragrid is made after reading and analyzing the content.</p>
