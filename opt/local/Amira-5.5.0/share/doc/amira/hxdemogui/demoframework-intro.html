<h1><a name="A1">6 Demo Framework</a></h1>
<p><a name="A2"></a>
<font face="helvetica">Demo Framework</font> adds a generalized framework for creating and
steering demonstrations with <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>.
</p>
<p>
Demonstrations are often prepared to present results of ones work to others.
Speaking in terms of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>, this means that scripts and data sets, e.g. .hx files and
AmiraMesh files have been compiled and stored for presentation.
After a while lots of scripts and their corresponding data files may have been spread
over many disks and computers by many people.
Now it's time to rearrange the demos and make them useable by others.</p>
<p><font face="helvetica">Demo Framework</font> enables you to put your demo collection in order.
It incorporates four major parts:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>A <a class="link" href="#A4">directory and file structure</a>
 containing the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> scripts to
 execute the demos, their description and their data. The directory
 structure may include a grouping and can also resemble a project
 structure of the demos.
<br />
</li><li>Several scripts to <a class="link" href="#A13">select demos</a>
 from the demo collection,
 utilities to download data from remote servers, helper scripts for
 demo steering, etc.
<br />
</li><li>A <a class="link" href="HxDemoGUI.html#A1">GUI</a>
 for conveniently selecting and changing demo collections.
<br />
</li><li><a class="link" href="../scriptobjects/DemoSequence.html#A1">DemoSequence</a>,
 an <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> script object for steering the selected demos.
<br />
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>A nice and easy way to create demos is the <a class="link" href="../scriptobjects/DemoMaker.html#A1">DemoMaker</a>,
which is included in the base version of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>.
With the DemoMaker you can interactively create an animated sequence of
actions of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> modules.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2><a name="A3">6.1 Directory Structure and Files</a></h2>
<p><a name="A4"></a>
In order to use <font face="helvetica">Demo Framework</font>, you must set environment variable
<tt>AMIRA_DEMOS</tt> &nbsp;to the directory that contains the demos.
This demo directory must have at least three subdirectories:
Environment variable <tt>AMIRA_ROOT</tt> &nbsp;pointing to the directory where <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> has
been installed, has to be set as well.</p>
<p></p>
<dl>
<dt>src/</dt>
<dd> The demo description files, <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> scripts, and
 thumbnail images must be stored here. Use subdirectories to
 organize the demos, for example, to reflect different projects or overall
 themes.<br />
</dd>
<dt>data/</dt>
<dd> This directory contains the data files in a subdirectory structure similar to
 src/. The <font face="helvetica">Mesh Option</font> files used in your demos must be stored here.<br />
</dd>
</dl><p></p>
<p>It may also have these subdirectories:</p>
<p></p>
<dl>
<dt>cacheddata/</dt>
<dd> This optional directory contains tar archives with
 the data sets for the demos in src/. It is filled when you download
 the data from a server.<br />
</dd>
<dt>output/</dt>
<dd> This is the default name of the folder where you find
 the selected demos if the selection has been done
 with the command-line tool.<br />
</dd>
<dt>selection/</dt>
<dd> Here you will find the selected demos if the selection has
 been done using the <a class="link" href="HxDemoGUI.html#A1">Demo GUI</a>.<br />
</dd>
</dl><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A5">6.1.1 Directories and Files in src/</a></h3>
<p><a name="A6"></a>
The directory structure is laid out recursively in order to group demos by
themes or topics. Folders which group subfolders are called
<em>container</em> or <em>project folders</em>,
while folders containing the demos, i.e., the
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> scripts, are called <em>demo folders</em>.
Due to their recursive structure, <em>project folders</em> can in turn contain
<em>project folders</em>, but <em>demo folders</em> cannot contain any
subfolders.</p>
<p>Folders are regarded either as a project or demo folder if they
have a file named <em>description.xml</em>. Otherwise the directories are not
considered to be part of the demo structure.</p>
<p>In order to set up a demo collection,
create a directory below <tt>$AMIRA_DEMOS/src</tt> which reflects the
structure of the subjects or projects you wish to prepare for demonstration.
See figure <a class="link" href="#A7">53</a> for example.</p>
<p></p><div style="text-align:center"><a name="A7"></a><a href=demoframework-intro_FileStructure.png.html><img width=375 src="demoframework-intro_FileStructure.png" /></a><br />
<div class="caption">
<b>Figure 53:</b>

<p>














































































</p>
<p>The above mentioned project folders are those folders which do
not contain <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> scripts (.hx files). However, they must contain a
<tt>description.xml</tt> file.
Like every other directory in the demo structure, such folders have a
<tt>gfx</tt>
directory which in turn contains images for representing the project as a whole.</p>
<p>The associated description file for a project folder could look like the following:</p>
<p><font size="2"></font></p><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
&lt;description style="project"&gt;
             &lt;!-- Use style="projectlist" in the very first
                  description.xml file directly in the product
                  root directory! --&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;
      Your Project Title
      &lt;!-- (Keep this title _short_ and _meaningful_)!
           Don't start with "Visualization of" since this is certainly
           the case in all demos. Consider that finding your demo
           within a huge list of titles might become difficult. --&gt;
   &lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;general&gt;
      Your Short Description.
      &lt;!-- Please, don't write a long story here - just two or three
           sentences. The text should guide an untrained presenter
           to explain your demo. --&gt;
   &lt;/general&gt;
   &lt;!-- you might want to register a staff tag here --&gt;
     &lt;staff&gt;
       &lt;person&gt;
         &lt;name&gt;Your Name&lt;/name&gt;
         &lt;userid&gt;yourname&lt;/userid&gt;
         &lt;email&gt;yourname@yourdomain&lt;/email&gt;
         &lt;tel&gt;xxx&lt;/tel&gt;
       &lt;/person&gt;
       &lt;!-- This information will give the presenter the chance to
            contact you in case your presence is desired or
            necessary. --&gt;
       &lt;!-- register more persons here --&gt;
     &lt;/staff&gt;
   &lt;!-- Please provide a thumbnail for this demo
        (e.g., the teaser of your project page) --&gt;
   &lt;thumbnail src="gfx/eyecatcher.png"/&gt;
&lt;/description&gt;

</pre><p><font size="2"></font></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Use <tt>projectlist</tt> as the value to the <tt>style</tt> attribute
for the description .xml file in the directory $<tt>AMIRA_DEMOS</tt>.</p>
<p>The final demo folders contain the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> scripts, the <tt>gfx</tt> directory with
one .png image for every demo step, and a description .xml file which may
look similar to this:</p>
<p><font size="2"></font></p><pre>

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
  &lt;description style="demo"&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;       
      &lt;attribute name="display" values="normal" /&gt;
      &lt;attribute name="version" values="zib-2006-2" /&gt;
      &lt;attribute name="topic" values="flow" /&gt;
      &lt;attribute name="state" values="released" /&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;
        Vector Field in a Bubble Chamber
    &lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;general&gt;
       In this demo several visualization methods
       for vector fields are shown.

       The data set comes from ...
    &lt;/general&gt;
    &lt;thumbnail src="gfx/teaser.png" /&gt;
    &lt;staff&gt;
      &lt;person status="responsible"&gt;
         &lt;name&gt;Your Name&lt;/name&gt;
         &lt;userid&gt;yourusername&lt;/userid&gt;
         &lt;email&gt;youremailaddress&lt;/email&gt;
         &lt;tel&gt;xxx&lt;/tel&gt;
      &lt;/person&gt;
      &lt;!-- register more persons here --&gt;
    &lt;/staff&gt;
      &lt;prepacked href="https://servername/prepackeddemodata"&gt;
        &lt;file src="bubble\_2006.06.22-1_data.tar.gz"/&gt;
      &lt;/prepacked&gt;
      &lt;demo&gt;
        &lt;script file="bubble.hx"/&gt;
          &lt;steps&gt;
           &lt;step name="Vectors" playcommand="vectors"&gt;
            Vector Arrows (For interactivity, pick plane
            and shift up or down)
           &lt;/step&gt;
           &lt;step name="LIC" playcommand="lic"&gt;
            Line Integral Convolution (LIC) (For interactivity
            pick plane and shift forward or backward)
           &lt;/step&gt;
           &lt;!-- add more steps here --&gt;
          &lt;/steps&gt;
      &lt;/demo&gt;
  &lt;/description&gt;
</pre><p><font size="2"></font></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You can use HTML tags to enhance titles and general descriptions
within the description file. The XSL parser is very strict,
so always use a <tt>/&gt;</tt> at the end for single tags like <tt>br</tt> or <tt>p</tt>.
Also be aware of the quite cumbersome encoding details.
If you are writing German with umlauts, be sure that your editor
also stores these characters as ISO-8859-1 encoding, also known as Latin1.
Otherwise you will get surprising results in your HTML output.</p>
<p>Each description file has a <tt>&lt;title&gt;</tt> and a <tt>&lt;general&gt;</tt> tag.
Inside a <tt>&lt;demo&gt;</tt> tag there must be a <tt>&lt;script&gt;</tt> tag and a
<tt>&lt;steps&gt;</tt> tag filled with <tt>&lt;step&gt;</tt> tags.</p>
<p>The <tt>&lt;demo&gt;</tt> tag can have an additional attribute, <tt>stepmode</tt>,
which can be set to <tt>random</tt> or <tt>static</tt>.
The latter should only be used for demos, where the sequence
of demo steps is strictly required (e.g., later steps rely on data
loaded by earlier steps etc.).
If no <tt>stepmode</tt> is specified, <tt>random</tt> is assumed.</p>
<p>The <tt>&lt;script&gt;</tt> tag has a filename of an <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>-script as an attribute.
This script is executed whenever the corresponding demo is started.
Use it to define Tcl procedures for subsequent steps and to load necessary
data sets and modules.</p>
<p>The <tt>&lt;step&gt;</tt> tag takes an optional name and a mandatory <tt>playcommand</tt>
attribute. An option is to register a <tt>jumpcommand</tt> attribute.
Please write a short but meaningful description for each step.
That way untrained users have a chance of presenting your demo as well.</p>
<p>The content of <tt>playcommand</tt> is executed as a Tcl command to display
the corresponding step.
The content of <tt>jumpcommand</tt> is executed as a Tcl command
to jump to the beginning of a step and display the first image.
This is useful if one wants to explain something before the step is executed.</p>
<p>In demo description files only, the <tt>&lt;description&gt;</tt> tag may contain
an optional <tt>&lt;prepacked&gt;</tt> tag that specifies the files to download.
<tt>.tar</tt> files are untarred automatically by <tt>downloadData.tcl</tt>,
and <tt>.tar.gz</tt> files are gunzipped before.
You can register any number of <tt>&lt;file&gt;</tt> tags inside
<tt>&lt;prepacked&gt;</tt>. The data to be tarred in order to use it as a
prepacked file should be stored relative to $<tt>AMIRA_DEMOS</tt> &nbsp;in a
directory called <tt>$AMIRA_DEMOS/data</tt>.</p>
<p>Also only in demo description files a <tt>&lt;attributes&gt;</tt> tag could be used
to allow a demo categorization by the search algorithm of the Demo GUI.</p>
<p>A <tt>&lt;staff&gt;</tt> tag filled with <tt>&lt;person&gt;</tt> tags of which one
may have the parameter status="responsible" can be registered below
<tt>&lt;description&gt;</tt> also.</p>
<p>If you compiled your demo using <a class="link" href="../scriptobjects/DemoMaker.html#A1">DemoMaker</a>,
you are in good shape.
Typing <tt>&lt;DemoMakerName&gt; writeDescriptionFile</tt> in the
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> console window
pops up a file browser. An appropriate <tt>description.xml</tt> file
is written with <tt>jumpcommand</tt> and <tt>playcommand</tt> supplied correctly.
All you have to do is fill in the descriptions for the demo as a
whole and for each step. Also, replace the step names with more
descriptive ones.
</p>
<p>Also a title must be given before
the <tt>description.xml</tt> file will work.</p>
<p>A description file that does not follow the conventions mentioned above will
be skipped when parsing of the demo file tree takes place.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A8">Creating thumbnail pictures</a></h4>
<p>Besides the explanation of the demo in the description file, a thumbnail image
can be helpful to show what kind of view one can expect from a particular
presentation.</p>
<p>Thumbnails are shown in the <a class="link" href="HxDemoGUI.html#A1">Demo GUI</a> and in the
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> help window when it is used for demo steering. Furthermore
demos can be started and steered with a web browser.
See <a class="link" href="#A17">below</a>.</p>
<p>If you have prepared your demos and set up selection as described below,
start <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> and type:
<font size="2"><tt>source $AMIRA_DEMOS/&lt;outputfolder&gt;/&lt;demodirectory&gt;/makeSnapshots.hx</tt></font>
in the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> console. Here <tt>&lt;outputfolder&gt;</tt> is 'selection' by default or,
when using the command line tools, 'output' resp. the name
specified in the -o option of <tt>prepareDemos.tcl</tt>.
After that there are as many step$$<$$N$$>$$.png files as there are steps defined
in the description file in a directory
<tt>$AMIRA_DEMOS/src/&lt;demodirectory&gt;/gfx/</tt>.</p>
<p>If for some reason you need manually created thumbnails for a particular demo,
proceed as follows:
Start that demo, and invoke source <tt>$AMIRA_DEMOS/setup/makeIcon.hx</tt>.
After that a Tcl procedure <tt>makeIcon</tt> has been defined.
Call it in the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> console with
<tt>makeIcon "&lt;thumbnail filename&gt;" &lt;width&gt; &lt;height&gt;</tt>.
Do not give a filename extension, <tt>.png</tt> will be added automatically
by <tt>makeIcon</tt>. If both values for width and height are given,
the viewer will be resized accordingly.
If one of these values set to 0, the viewer image will be
scaled using Lanczos interpolation.</p>
<p>Note: For better image quality, set your viewer size to
a multiple of the thumbnail size
(in the default case 150x150 for thumbnails =$$>$$ 900x900 viewer size).
Also consider the contents of the viewer --if there are many small
features, they won't be visible in the thumbnail.
As is often true, less is more.</p>
<p>Final remark: Consider the description together with the thumbnail images
as a storyboard. It should describe the story you want to tell the
audience while presenting the demonstration.
Indeed you find a file <tt>storyboard.html</tt> in your output folder after
you have setup a selection. It contains all descriptions and thumbnails
of the whole selection together in one file. Useful for browsing and
printing with your favourite webbrowser.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A9">6.1.2 Data Storage</a></h3>
<p><a name="A10"></a>
All data being used in the demos should be stored in the
<tt>$AMIRA_DEMOS/data/</tt> directory.
You should create a directory similar in structure to
<tt>$AMIRA_DEMOS/src/</tt> for storing your data.</p>
<p>The advantages of storing the data this way are:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>the data is separated from the script files.</li><li>a data file can easily be identified with the demo to which it belongs.</li><li>the data can be copied for <em>pack-and-go</em> automatically
 (see <a class="link" href="#A17">below</a>).</li><li>the data can be used by several demos without needing to be duplicated.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A11">Using a File Server to Store the Demo Data</a></h3>
<p>If you want to use the same demo data sets on several computers
(perhaps at different locations), it may
be helpful to store the data files in a tar archive on a remote http server.</p>
<p><em>It is beyond the scope of this documentation to explain how to
set up such a server.</em></p>
<p>If you decided to use a data server, define a naming scheme for your data sets
and save the data sets on the server according to that scheme. Now use
the URL for the data in your <tt>description.xml</tt> files.
Be sure to create the tar files relative to $<tt>AMIRA_DEMOS</tt>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>The following lines of <tt>description.xml</tt> contain the data to be
downloaded:</p>
<p><font size="2"></font></p><pre>
    &lt;prepacked href="https://servername/prepackeddemodata"&gt;
      &lt;file src="bubble_2006.06.22-1_data.tar.gz"/&gt;
    &lt;/prepacked&gt;
</pre><p><font size="2"></font></p>
<p>and <tt>bubble_2006.06.22-1_data.tar.gz</tt> contains:</p>
<p><font size="2"></font></p><pre>
tar tvf bubble_2006.06.22-1_data.tar
... 2006-06-22 12:10:10 data/cfd/bubblechamber/
... 2006-06-22 12:29:20 data/cfd/bubblechamber/physics.am
... 2006-06-22 12:29:01 data/cfd/bubblechamber/Blasensaeule.surf
... 2006-06-22 12:10:10 data/cfd/bubblechamber/streamsurface.surf
... 2006-06-22 12:29:20 data/cfd/bubblechamber/Vektorfeld_GW_01.am
</pre><p><font size="2"></font></p>
<p>In order to fetch all data sets, you must download them as follows
prior to starting the demos:



<font size="2"></font></p><pre>
cd $AMIRA_DEMOS/hxdemos/src
tclsh $AMIRA_DEMOS/hxroot/share/hxdemos-scripts/downloadData.tcl
</pre><p><font size="2"></font>
<tt>downloadData.tcl</tt> has no parameters or options!</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> <tt>downloadData.tcl</tt> downloads ALL data files mentioned
in the <tt>prepacked</tt> tag of the description.xml files found in the
recursively traversed directory tree!
All downloaded files are stored in the directory
<tt>$AMIRA_DEMOS/cacheddata</tt>. Before <tt>downloadData.tcl</tt>
downloads the files from the server, it checks to see if the files
scheduled for downloading are already in the <i>cacheddata</i> directory.
This ensures that a possibly time-consuming download is done only once.
Then all files with the extensions
<tt>.tar</tt>, <tt>.tar.gz</tt> or <tt>.tgz</tt> are unpacked
to <tt>$AMIRA_DEMOS/data</tt> while all other files are copied to that
folder.
Depending on the amount of data you stored on your data server, this may take a
quite a while and use a lot of disk space.</p>
<p>See <a class="link" href="#A17">below</a> for downloading only those
data files which are needed for a certain demo selection.</p>
<p></p>
<h2><a name="A12">6.2 Selecting Demos</a></h2>
<p><a name="A13"></a>
Demos can be selected in two ways:</p>
<p></p>
<ol><li>The most preferable way is to use the <a class="link" href="HxDemoGUI.html#A1">Demo GUI</a>, or</li><li>to use the command-line tool <tt>prepareDemos.tcl</tt>.</li>
</ol><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A14">Demo GUI</a></h3>
<p><a name="A15"></a>
The Demo GUI provides a very convenient way for selecting demos
from a pool of available demos.
It is also possible to change a demo selection afterwards.
A demo selection can be saved in an <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> script file for running it later.
For more information, see the <a class="link" href="HxDemoGUI.html#A1">Demo GUI documentation</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A16">Command-line Tools</a></h3>
<p><a name="A17"></a>
If for any reason the <em>Demo GUI</em> couldn't be used to select demos, you
can use a command-line tool <tt>prepareDemos.tcl</tt> to do the selection.</p>
<p>The command-line tools are stored under
<tt>$AMIRA_ROOT/share/hxdemos-scripts</tt>.</p>
<p>You can specify a selection of folders and steps as parameters to
create adapted output in a subdirectory <tt>$AMIRA_DEMOS/output</tt>.</p>
<p>The subdirectory then contains a file named <tt>demosequence.hx</tt>
which is an <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> script for executing the selected demos.
<tt>demosequence.demo</tt> contains the demos and their steps and
is used by the <a class="link" href="../scriptobjects/DemoSequence.html#A1">DemoSequence</a>
module for steering. Load the script into <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> to start the demos.</p>
<p>Additionally an <tt>index.html</tt> file which can be used to control the demos
from a web browser. To do so, start <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> and execute the command
<tt>httpd start</tt> in the console and afterwards direct your favorite
web browser to the URL
<font size="2"><tt>http://localhost:7000/&lt;$AMIRA_DEMOS&gt;/&lt;outputfolder&gt;/index.html</tt></font>
where <tt>&lt;outputfolder&gt;</tt> is <tt>output</tt> or the directory
specified with the <tt>-o</tt> option.</p>
<p>It is also possible to load the <tt>index.html</tt> file into <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> and
start the demos from <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>'s help window.</p>
<p>The full syntax of <tt>prepareDemos.tcl</tt> is</p>
<p><font size="2"></font></p><pre>

be created under the pack-and-go folder.</p>
<p>The <tt>--packandgo</tt> option copies all files recursively from the
<tt>$AMIRA_DEMOS/src</tt> folder to a directory <tt>src</tt> under the
folder specified for this option.
The needed data sets are then copied from the directory
<tt>$AMIRA_DEMOS/cacheddata</tt> into that folder, too.
After that, you must unpack these tar files relative to the pack-and-go
folder.</p>
<p>In order to have the data ready in <em>cacheddata</em>,
specify the <tt>--download</tt> option.</p>
<p>As an alternative way to provide the needed data it is possible to supply
a <tt>--datainclude</tt> option in conjunction with the <tt>--packandgo</tt>
option. This option must have a selection of
pathnames relative to <tt>$AMIRA_DEMOS/data</tt> which are copied
to a data folder under the pack-and-go folder.</p>
<p>It is now possible to set the $<tt>AMIRA_DEMOS</tt> &nbsp;environment variable to the pack
and go folder.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Be sure not to have any "/" (slash) at the end of a path since this
leads to wrong results. Please, don't use the options <tt>--datainclude</tt> and
<tt>--include</tt> together in conjunction with <tt>--packandgo</tt>, cause it copies
way too much into the packandgo folder.</p>
<p>Example:
<font size="2">&nbsp;<br />
 <tt>cd $AMIRA_DEMOS/src</tt>
&nbsp;<br />
 <tt>tclsh $AMIRA_ROOT/share/hxdemos-scripts/prepareDemos.tcl cfd/bubblechamber medicine/hyperthermia -s "1 2 5" --download --output mydemo</tt></font></p>
<p>
This selects the entire bubble chamber demo and three steps from the hyperthermia demo
and stores the necessary files in <tt>$AMIRA_DEMOS/mydemo</tt>.
The requested data sets for the two demos are stored under
<tt>$AMIRA_DEMOS/data</tt> if there is a <tt>&lt;prepacked&gt;</tt> tag in the
appropriate description files.</p>
<p>On Unix/Linux systems start <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> with
<tt>$AMIRA_ROOT/bin/start $AMIRA_DEMOS/mydemo/demosequence.hx</tt> and on
Windows systems load <tt>$AMIRA_DEMOS/mydemo/demosequence.hx</tt> just after
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> has been started.</p>
<p>Pack-and-Go Example:
<font size="2">&nbsp;<br />
 <tt>tclsh $AMIRA_ROOT/share/hxdemos-scripts/prepareDemos.tcl --packandgo /media/disk/hxdemos brusselator microvisu/gigamosaic microvisu/synchrotron microvisu/smallnetwork</tt></font></p>
<p>This creates a folder named <tt>hxDemos</tt> under <tt>/media/disk/</tt>,
selects four demos and puts the output into that folder.
You also find under that folder the needed data as tar files,
named as described in the appropriate description .xml file.</p>
<p></p>
<h2><a name="A18">6.3 Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>The following system tools and programs are used by <font face="helvetica">Demo Framework</font>:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>A recent version of <tt>tclsh</tt> and <tt>xsltproc</tt> is required
 for the scripts <tt>prepareDemos.tcl</tt> and <tt>downloadData.tcl</tt>.<br />
</li><li><tt>wget</tt> and either <tt>gtar</tt> or <tt>gzip</tt> and <tt>tar</tt>
 is required for <tt>downloadData.tcl</tt>.<br />
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>On Unix/Linux systems all tools should already be installed.</p>
<p>On Windows systems all tools should already be installed in <em>cygwin</em>
as well. If <tt>xsltproc</tt> is missing, it is part of the package <tt>libxslt</tt>.
Make sure that the <tt>PATH</tt> environment variable includes <tt>cygwin/bin</tt>
to be able to use it via <tt>exec</tt> in Tcl scripts.</p>
