<b>Figure 1:</b>
The Multi-planar Viewer.</div>


</div><p></p>
<p>The Multi-planar Viewer is activated by pressing the Multiplanar Viewer button in the 
sub-application task bar. This will change the layout of the main and viewer 
window as shown in <a class="link" href="#A2">Figure 1</a>. The main components of this layout are 
the viewer (MPR+3D viewer), the user interface to control the visualization, 
the toolbox, and information area.</p>
<p><b>The MPR+3D viewer</b><br />

By default, the viewer is displayed in 4-viewer mode. 
If you prefer to work with one larger view rather than four smaller views,
double-click on the viewer of your choice. To switch back to 4-viewer mode just 
double-click on the single viewer again. Right-clicking on a viewer 
activates the context-menu through which you can access tools and visualization options.</p>
<p><b>The User Interface</b>
</p>
<ul><li><p><b>Data Selectors</b>: In the upper part of the main window two data 
selectors allow selecting the primary and secondary image volumes to be 
displayed. The pull-down menus will list all compatible data objects that are
available in Amira's workspace (<b>Pool)</b>). We define the terms "Primary" and "Overlay" in the 
 context of the Multiplanar Viewer as:</p>

<ul><li><b>Primary</b> - Reference data set. This data set will be considered our principal data set
 to which a secondary data set could be eventually compared or registered. 
 In the context of PET/CT fusion, the CT data set would be used as reference 
 data set as it provides the best anatomical reference.</li><li><b>Overlay</b> - Secondary data set, which could be compared or registered to the Primary.</li>
</ul></li><li><p><b>2D Settings</b>: controls for the colormap settings, the Primary-Overlay ratio 
(or the Alpha transparency if just one data set is displayed), 
the thickness and rendering mode of the thick slice in the 2D viewers.
Thick slice rendering Modes:</p>

<ul><li><b>MIP</b> - Maximum intensity projection. The brightest 
data value along each ray of sight in the thick slice is displayed. 
This mode is especially useful for very sparse data sets, for example, 
angiographic data or images of neurons.</li><li><b>MinIP</b> - Minimum intensity projection. Same as MIP but with the darkest value.</li><li><b>Average</b> - The average data value along each ray in the thick slice is calculated and displayed.</li>
</ul></li><li><p><b>3D Settings</b>: same as 2D Settings but applied to the 3D viewer. Volume Rendering Modes: </p>

<ul><li><b>VRT</b> - Texture-based volume rendering, with optional shading effects. 
If VRT is selected the user can optionally set the light effect to "normal", "diffuse", or "specular".</li><li><b>MIP</b> - Maximum intensity projection. The brightest data value along each ray of sight is displayed 
instead of the result of the emission absorption model. If MIP is selected the 
user can optionally set the visualization effect to "normal" or "inverse".</li><li><b>3D MPR button</b> - Turns on/off the MPR in the 3D viewer.</li>
</ul></li><li><b>Label Field</b>: In the central part of the editor window boxes allow 
to select the LabelField object to be visualized. This port refers to the Primary data set; 
to be activated the loaded LabelField must to have the same dimensions as the Primary data set. If the 
port is activated and the checked, the materials will be listed in the window below.
You can optionally turn on/off the 3D rendering, select a constant color for rendering, or 
fade the labeled voxels.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p><b>The Toolbox</b><br />

Below the label window, a toolbox provides access for the registration 
tools. Depending on the currently selected tool the 
area below the tool bar will show additional controls. The registration tools are activated only 
if the Primary and the Overlay are both available and the tools are applied to the Overlay data set.
Two tabs are available in the toolbox: the Automatic and the Manual Registration.</p>
<p><img src="AutoRegistr.png" /> <b>Automatic Registration</b><br />

The interface and the functionalities of the Automatic Registration tools are the same 
as the <a class="link" href="../hxregistration/HxAffineRegistration.html#A1">AffineRegistration</a> module. Please see its documentation for a complete description and tutorial.
In additon the <em>Monitor</em> toggle allows the user to track the actual registration progress.</p>
<p><img src="CorrectRegistr.png" /><b>Transform Editor Options</b><br />
</p>
<p>The interface and the functionality of the Transform Editor Options
corresponds to the dialog of the <a class="link" href="../hxcore/HxTransformEditor.html#A1">Transform Editor</a>. Please refer to the Transform Editor documentation for a complete description.</p>
<p><b>Information Area</b><br />
</p>
<p>At the bottom of the control panel a status area informs the user about 
the data being visualized.</p>
