<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
 PDB is a file format for storing structures of biomolecules.
 The format is used for archiving molecules in the online protein
 data base. [http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/]</p>
<p> <b>Supported records</b></p>
<p> <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> uses most, but not all, information supplied in a PDB file.
 The following record types will be parsed:<br />

 <tt>HELIX SHEET TURN SITE MODEL ENDMDL ATOM HETATM TER CONECT END</tt><br />

 The rest will be skipped.</p>
<p> When saving a structure, the following record types will be written:<br />

 <tt>HEADER TITLE AUTHOR<br />

 SEQRES HELIX SHEET TURN SITE SSBOND<br />

 ATOM HETATM TER CONECT MASTER END</tt></p>
<p> <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> supports PDB files that follow the conventions of PDB format
 version 2.0 or higher.</p>
<p> <b>How to identify PDB groups in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font></b></p>
<p> In <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> all levels (atoms, residues, bonds , ...) contain
 a set of information fields called attributes. Every level contains
 the field `index' which is an internal
 identifier that does not necessarily correspond to the succession
 of the groups in the file.</p>
<p> If the molecule has been read from a PDB file then the <b>atom</b> 'name' field
 is composed of the chain name and the sequence number (columns 7 - 11) 
 of the respective <tt>ATOM</tt> records. The field 'index' only corresponds
 to the sequence number if the enumeration of pdb atoms is continuous.</p>
<p> The `type' field contains the information of the
 field named `atom name' (columns 13 - 16) in the PDB file.</p>
<p> The `name' field of <b>chains</b> contains the chainID
 (column 22) of the respective <tt>ATOM</tt> record. <tt>HETATM</tt> records whose
 chainID field is empty will not belong to any chain in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>.
 The chain name of atoms belonging to <tt>ATOM</tt> records whose <tt>chainID</tt>
 field is empty will be set to `NIL'.</p>
<p> The `name' field of <b>residues</b> is composed of the chain name
 and the residue sequence number (columns 23 - 26). 
 If the residue is a het-group, the name will start with `HET'. </p>
<p> The field `type' contains the residue names (columns 18 - 20). If none
 is given, the field will be set to `UNK' (for unknown).</p>
<p> <b>Example:</b></p>
<p> <font size="2"></font></p><pre>
  ATOM   441  CB  VAL L  58   ... 
  21.025  37.362  -2.515  ... 
  1.00  8.15  1IGM 562
</pre><p><font size="2"></font>
 The atom will be known with name 'L441' and comment `CB'.
 It will belong to the residue with name `L58' and of type `VAL' 
 which is sited on the chain with name `L'.</p>
<p> It is possible to save trajectories in the PDB format. Note, however,
 that this is inefficient due to the redundancy of information of the atom
 records in each model entry.</p>
<p> <b>Possible problems</b></p>
<p> Some molecular modeling packages use slightly altered conventions
 for saving PDB files. If you encounter any problems in reading such 
 files please check the following section and adjust your files 
 as necessary.</p>
<p> <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> can read <b>several models of one molecule as a trajectory</b> 
 if the different versions
 are separately declared between <tt>MODEL</tt> and <tt>ENDMDL</tt> records. 
 If there are
 several possible conformations in one model (by using alternate location
 identificators), <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> will read only the first version 
 (that one with the <tt>altLocId</tt> `A').</p>
<p> Molecules that are declared as models need to have the same number of atoms
 as <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> will only read the topology once. Only the coordinates are
 read in for each timestep. If you have <b>several different molecules</b>
 in one
 PDB file, you can separate them by <tt>END</tt> records. <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> will load every
 molecule ended by an <tt>END</tt> record separately, creating its own
 data object.</p>
<p> The <b>automatic creation of bonds</b> of peptide and RNA/DNA residues 
 is done by comparing the atoms of the
 residues with a residue database. 
 The method requires
 the atom names and the residue names to follow the PDB standard.
 Sometimes third party programs write atoms like O3* as O3'. This
 will prevent <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> from recognizing the atoms in the database.
 Connections between consecutive residues is done by checking the sequence
 of residues of each chain. <b>Bonds of non-standard residues</b> must
 be declared in the connect records.</p>
<p> Columns 77-78 should contain the element name of the atom. In some PDB
 files, this field is empty or contains other information. 
 In this case, <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> uses the first two letters of the atom name to
 determine the atom type. However, in special cases this is not
 unequivocal. The field is not allowed to contain non-numerical
 information.</p>
<p> All information in columns 79-80 is interpreted as the charge of the atom.
 Thus, line numbers in this field will lead to strange charge values.</p>
<p> You can get complete documentation of the file format at 
 http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/.</p>
<p>	If you have an active network connection and know the PDB-Id, you can also load 
	the structure directly from rcsb.org. To do so use the Tcl command
</p><pre>
  newMolFromPDB &lt;PDB-ID&gt;
</pre><p>
where PDB-ID is the ID of the structure (for example 1HVR). The command works asynchronously. 
Depending on file size and bandwidth the process may take a few seconds up to several minutes.
The requested pdb entry will appear as a new object in the object pool.</p>
