<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This module is created automatically if files are imported via the <em>Open Time Series Data...</em> option of the main window's <em>File</em> menu. The
module assumes that all files selected in the file browser represent the
same data object at different time steps. Instead of loading all files
at once, a slider is provided allowing the user to select the current
time step. Whenever a new time step is loaded data, objects associated
with a previous time step are replaced. The replacement is performed in
such a way that connections to down-stream modules are retained.</p>
<p>The time series module is also able to linearly interpolate between
subsequent time steps. However, this only works for certain types of
data objects, namely surfaces, tetrahedral grids, hexahedral grids, fields
defined on surfaces, tetrahedral or hexahedral grids, and data objects
derived from the vertex set base class. In addition, it is required
that for each time step the same number of data objects be created,
that corresponding data objects are created in the same order in all
time steps, and that corresponding data objects have the same number of
vertices or elements. For example, you cannot easily interpolate between
surfaces with a different number of triangles (<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> provides other
modules to support this). If multiple data objects are created for each
time step, interpolation of particular objects can be suppressed by
switching off the orange viewer toggle of these objects.</p>
<p>In addition to the step number, the module can also display the physical
time associated with each time step, provided the physical time is
specified as a <em>Time</em> parameter for each data object. It is required
that the physical times of subsequent time steps be monotonically
increasing. In order to use physical time mode, the relevant time
steps must be loaded in index mode first.</p>

<h3>Ports</h3>

<div class="hxport">
 <span class="headline">Info</span>  
<div class="portsnapshot"><img src="HxDynamicFileSeriesCtrl_info.png" /><br /></div>
<div class="body"><p>This port displays the total number of time steps. If the data objects
provide a physical time in a <em>Time</em> parameter, the physical time
range is displayed too. If the last time step has not yet been loaded,
a question mark is printed instead of the maximum time value. In addition,
if a physical time is provided, the current physical time or the current
time step index is displayed, depending on the value of the <em>physical
time toggle</em>.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="hxport">
 <span class="headline">Cached steps</span>  
<div class="portsnapshot"><img src="HxDynamicFileSeriesCtrl_cachedSteps.png" /><br /></div>
<div class="body"><p>Allows you to adjust the cache size. By default every time step is cached,
i.e., the number of cached steps is equal to the total number of time
steps. If the number of cached steps is zero the cache is disabled.
Data objects associated with a previous time step are deleted before
a new time step is loaded. Interpolation mode requires a cache size of
two, i.e., in addition to the current interpolated time step, at least
two additional time steps have to be stored in memory.</p>

<div class="hxport">
 <span class="headline">Options</span>  
<div class="portsnapshot"><img src="HxDynamicFileSeriesCtrl_options.png" /><br /></div>
<div class="body"><p>The first toggle is used to activate <em>interpolation mode</em>. In this mode,
fractional time steps can be specified and a linear interpolation between
two subsequent time steps is performed. Note that interpolation can only be
performed if certain requirements are met (details are described above).</p>
<p>The second toggle is used to activate <em>physical time mode</em>. Physical
time mode is only available if the loaded data objects provide a <em>Time</em> parameter. In physical time mode the time slider displays the
physical time instead of the current time step. </p>
<p>The third toggle is used to apply to the data of the next (or previous) timestep
the geometric transformation(s) applied to the data open at the current time step.</p>
<p>The fourth toggle is used to copy all the parameters of the current time step data
to the parameters of the data of the next (or previous) timestep.</p>

<div class="portsnapshot"><img src="HxDynamicFileSeriesCtrl_time.png" /><br /></div>
<div class="body"><p>Specifies the current time step or the current physical time. The port
provides a popup menu (right mouse button click) which can be used to
configure settings like animation mode or subrange interval. The two outer
buttons allow you to automatically animate the time step or the physical time
forwards or backwards. Animation speed in physical time mode can
be controlled via the increment value in the configure dialog.</p>
