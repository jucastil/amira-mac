<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Nifti is a file format for the exchange of neuro imaging data.</p>
<p>With this reader and writer you can import and export files in the Nifti format
in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>. Not all possible Nifti formats are supported (see Limitations).</p>
<p>Nifti data objects can consist of two files, a <tt>.hdr</tt> file
containing the header information and an <tt>.img</tt> file which contains the raw
image data. Both files should be in the same directory.</p>
<p>A dedicated file extension <tt>.nii</tt> for storing the header
and the data in the same file is available. This is the default
format for Nifti file export. Optionally, the file can be compressed.
In order to enable compression for file export, you need to choose
a file name with the extension <tt>.nii.gz</tt> in the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> file dialog.</p>
<p>The reader will scan the data directory for an additional file with
the extension <tt>.atlas.xml</tt>. This file is assumed to contain additional 
XML encoded information about the names and colors of materials stored
in the nifti data file. Such a file will also we written if a LabelField
is exported as Nifti file.</p>
<p><b>Limitations:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Only data sets with up to 4 dimensions are supported. nu, nv, nw have to
be 0 or 1. The time steps are imported as a dynamic time series in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>.</li><li>Supported data types are: unsigned char, signed short, unsigned short,
signed int, unsigned int, float, double, RGBA colorfield (read only).</li><li>If the scl_slope variable is defined scl_slope and scl_inter will be used
to scale the data while reading it. Please note, that this may introduce a loss
of precision depending on the data type.</li><li>Due to the way coordinates are encoded in a Nifti file, the origin of
the bounding box of an imported data set will be always set to (0,0,0). Any
translations will be encoded in the object's transformation matrix.</li><li>Only 3D scalar image with uniform coordinates can be exported in Nifti format.</li><li>Currently only <tt>.nii</tt> and <tt>.nii.gz</tt> files can be exported, but not 
<tt>.hdr</tt> and <tt>.img</tt> files.</li>
