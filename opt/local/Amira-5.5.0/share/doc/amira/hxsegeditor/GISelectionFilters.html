<h3><a name="A1">Selection Filters</a></h3>
<p>Under the <em>Selection</em> button of the menu bar several filters for
modifying the current selection are provided. These include simple
morphological operations, smoothing filters, and interpolation tools.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><b>Grow:</b> This filter performs a morphological dilatation of 
 the current selection, i.e., the selection is made bigger by one
 pixel in every direction. The filter can be applied to the current
 slice only (shortcut is <em>Ctrl +</em>), to all slices (orientation
 is defined by the active viewer), or to the whole volume.
 <br />
</li><li><b>Shrink:</b> This filter performs a morphological erosion of 
 the current selection, i.e., the selection is made smaller by one
 pixel in every direction. The filter can be applied to the current
 slice only (shortcut is <em>Ctrl -</em>), to all slices (orientation
 is defined by the active viewer), or to the whole volume.
 <br />
</li><li><b>Fill:</b> This filter fills the current selection, i.e., it closes
 all holes in it. The filter can be applied to the current slice only
 (shortcut is key <em>F</em>), or to all slices (orientation is defined by
 the active viewer).
 <br />
</li><li><b>Smooth:</b> This filter smooths the current selection. Smoothing
 works by applying a Gauss filter to the binary selection image and
 then reselecting all pixels with an intensity bigger than 0.5. Usually
 the filter is applied to a selection computed by the threshold filter
 or by the magic wand tool. The shortcut for this filter is <em>Ctrl
 M</em>.<br />
</li><li><b>Invert:</b> This filter inverts the current selection, i.e.,
 selected voxels are deselected, while unselected voxels are selected.
 The filter can be applied in the current slice only or in the whole volume.
 (The shortcut <em>I</em> works either on the current slice or the whole volume, 
 depending on the state of the <em>All slices/Current slice</em> radio button 
 in the <em>Selection</em> area.)
 <br />
</li><li><p><b>Snakes...:</b> This filter automatically fits the contour of a
 selected region to the edges of the image. Edges are regions with a
 high contrast. </p>
<p> An additional dialog is opened, which allows you to copy the selection
 from the current slice into the next or previous slice (up and down
 arrows). After copying, the snakes algorithm tries to adjust the contour
 to the gray values in the new slice.</p>
<p> Clicking on <i>Adjust</i> runs the same algorithm on the current
 selection in the current slice. This is especially useful to readjust
 after a manual correction. </p>
<p> If <i>Extrapolate</i> is switched on, the selection is not only copied
 to the next slice but extrapolated by taking into account selections in
 the two previous slices.</p>
<p> If <i>3DInfo</i> is switched on, a modified snakes algorithm is used
 which gives better results in the case of relatively equal voxel sizes
 in all three directions.</p>
<p> <i>Relax</i> smooths the contour of the current selection.
 <br />
</p></li><li><b>Make Ellipse:</b> Pressing this button causes the selected area to
 be replaced by an ellipse that fits the original selection as well as
 possible. The filter operates on the current slice of the active viewer.
 <br />
</li><li><b>Interpolate:</b> This button interpolates the selection between
 all slices where areas have been selected manually. Pressing the button
 again after performing corrections in certain slices will interpolate
 the selections between all slices where changes have been made. For
 example, suppose you have selected an object in slice 1 and in slice
 10. Pressing the <em>Interpolate</em> button automatically computes a
 selection in slices 2...9. You may then modify the selection in slice
 5, e.g., using the <em>Brush</em> tool. Pressing <em>Interpolate</em> again
 now interpolates the selection in slices 2...4 and 6...9. The shortcut 
 for this filter is <em>Ctrl I</em>.
 <br />
</li><li><p><b>Wrap:</b> This filter also interpolates the selection. However,
 a different algorithm based on scattered data interpolation with radial
 basis functions is applied. The filter always operates in 3D. In
 contrast to the previous filter, it is possible to start from slices with
 different orientations, e.g., after selecting slices in each spatial
 direction (xy, xz, yz) this tool can be used to compute an
 interpolating selection which wraps up the object whose skeleton is
 given by the slices.</p>
<p> <b>Note:</b> Initially no two successive slices with the same orientation must
 be labeled. Otherwise, an error message is displayed. The tool may
 take a few seconds to complete its operation. The shortcut for this
 filter is <em>Ctrl W</em>.</p></li>
