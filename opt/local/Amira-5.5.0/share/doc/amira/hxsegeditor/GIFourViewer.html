<h3><a name="A1">Working in 4-viewer Mode</a></h3>
<p>Initially, in each 2D image of the image segmentation editor the current
slice with colored contours surrounding the different segments is shown.
Near the bottom of the image you find a slider to control which slice of the 3D
volume is currently displayed. The slice number and the total number of slices
is displayed in textual form at the top of each 2D slice window. 
The orientation of the slice can be changed via the menu entry <em>View Orientation</em> in the menu bar.
In medical notation XZ denotes an axial slice, XZ a frontal slice, and YZ a sagittal slice.
</p>
<p>A viewer
can be made the active viewer by clicking in the viewer itself. The last
window you worked in will be active. Be careful
when clicking into the image in 3D mode. If the <em>Pick</em> tool or the 
<em>Magic Wand</em> tool is active the resulting selection operation may
take some time to compute. 
Use <em>Segmentation/Undo</em> to remove any unwanted selections.
All 2D operations like the "+" or "-" are always
performed in the active viewer, i.e., the slice and orientation of the
active viewer will be considered.</p>

<p><b>The 3D viewer</b></p>
<p>The lower-right viewer is an independent viewer where several special 
segmentation actions and selections are supported. You can activate the 
3D rendering of the data by clicking the <em>3D Volume Rendering</em> button
of the <em>Display and Masking</em> area. Whereas the <em>3D MPR</em> button
is a tri state button alternating the rendering of the 3D MPR slices from opaque
to transparent and finally to turned off, by pushing the button repeatedly.
Within the <em>Display and Masking</em> area you can also turn on/off the crosshair
of the MPR, set the colormap and the 3D rendering window. The crosshair button
activates the crosshair tool. It simply displays a crosshair in all three orthogonal viewers.
The colors denote the different directions
(red=x-axis, green=y-axis, blue=z-axis). You can click and grab 
one of the axes or their crossing point. The checkbox <em>Enable masking</em> 
enables the masking of the data, which 
is a useful feature for several <a class="link" href="GITools.html#A1">segmentation tools</a>.</p>
<p>By default, the current selection will be displayed in the 3D viewer as a 
point cloud. After each change of the current selection 
(i.e., after each brush stroke), the display will be updated. 
On slower computers or for very large data sets, this may become slow. 
Deselect the <a class="link" href="GIEditButtons.html#A4">Show in 3D toggle</a> to disable display of 
the highlighted region in the 3D viewer. In the 
<a class="link" href="GIMaterialList.html#A1">Material List</a>, toggle the 2D and 3D checkboxes to 
switch the material visible or invisible in the 3D viewer.</p>

<p><b>Using the zoom buttons</b></p>
<p>The zoom buttons control the size of the image. An info line on the right
hand side of the buttons shows the current zoom factor. For example a zoom
of 2:1 means that 2 pixels on the screen correspond to one pixel of the
original data set (magnification), while 1:4 would mean that four pixels
of the data set correspond to one pixel on the screen. If the pixel size
is not the same in all dimensions, the zoom factor belongs to the
horizontal direction only, to maintain the correct aspect ratio of the
voxels. If the <em>Current viewer</em> button is selected then the zoom buttons only 
apply to the currently active viewer.</p>
<p><b>Data range, histogram, and colormaps</b></p>
<p>The histogram displays the distribution of values in the image. 
Use the sliders below it to adjust the data range for the display.
You can adjust the range by clicking and dragging the right and left edges
of the slider bar. You can adjust the entire range at once by clicking and
dragging the center of the slider bar, which will adjust the brightness. 
The range slider can be dragged beyond the minimum and maximum values of 
the image, causing the histogram to rescale accordingly. 
If the <em>Current viewer</em> button is checked, then
the slider changes the data window of the currently active viewer only.</p>
<p>The colormap of the image can be changed from the default gray ramp 
to another colormap by pressing the <em>Select colormap</em> button. </p>
