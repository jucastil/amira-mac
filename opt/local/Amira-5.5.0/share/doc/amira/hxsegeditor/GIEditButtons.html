<p>The basic principle of the segmentation editor is to first select voxels
and then to assign, subtract, and replace etc. the selected voxels to or from the
current active material. A basic set of tools working with selections are described
in the following:</p>
<p><b>All slices / Current slice:</b> <a name="A3"></a>
Lets
 you choose to operate on <em>All slices</em> or just the <em>Current slice</em> i.e.,
 if you have selected <em>All slices</em>, all the selection tools described below will
 operate in 3D mode. For example, the <em>Clear</em> button clears the whole 3D selection,
 not only the current slice. In order to warn the user, all selection tools will show
 red colored icons instead of gray ones indicating that voxels are selected, which
 aren't visible within the current <em>2D viewer</em> slices.</p>
<p><b>Show in 3D:</b> <a name="A4"></a>
Lets you display the current
 selection within the <em>3D viewer</em>. On slower computers or for very large data sets,
 this may become slow.</p>
<p><img src="GI_clear.png" /> <b>Clear:</b> This button lets you clear the current selection.
 If <em>All slices</em> is activated, the selection is cleared in all slices.</p>
<p><img src="GI_replace.png" /> <b>Replace:</b> This button tries to replace a selected region.
 Assume you want to modify the contours of some region. As long as the
 new contours fully enclose the previous ones this can be easily
 achieved using the "+" button. However, if the new region is smaller,
 things are more complicated. The replace button looks for connected
 regions under the current selection belonging to the current material.
 Pixels which belong to such a region but which are not selected are
 automatically assigned to some other neighboring material. Selected
 pixels are assigned to the current material. In this way a replacement
 is performed.</p>
<p><img src="GI_plus.png" /> <b>Add:</b> This button adds all selected voxels to the material
 currently selected in the material list. Voxels assigned to a locked
 material are not affected. If the <em>Shift</em> key is held down while
 clicking the button, the voxels remain selected. Otherwise the
 selection is cleared afterwards.</p>
<p><img src="GI_minus.png" /> <b>Subtract:</b> This button lets you subtract all selected voxels
 belonging to the current material from that material, provided the
 current material is not locked. The pixels are automatically assigned
 to some neighboring material which is interpreted as a local
 background.</p>
<p><img src="GI_previous.png" /> <b>Previous:</b> This button displays in the
 active <em>2D viewer</em> the slice previous to the current slice 
 (lower slice number) that contains at least one selected voxel (red overlay).
 If no such slice exists, clicking this button doesn't change the current
 <em>2D viewer</em> slice position at all.</p>
<p><img src="GI_next.png" /> <b>Next:</b> This button displays in the active 
 <em>2D viewer</em> the next slice after the current slice (higher slice number) 
 that contains at least one selected voxel (red overlay).
 If no such slice exists, clicking this button doesn't change the current
 <em>2D viewer</em> slice position at all.</p>
<p><img src="GI_shrink.png" /> <b>Shrink:</b> This filter performs a morphological 
 erosion of the current selection, i.e., the selection is made smaller by one
 pixel in every direction. The filter can be applied to the current
 slice only (shortcut is <em>Ctrl -</em>), to all slices (orientation
 is defined by the active viewer), or to the whole volume. You can access 
 this command also though the item <a class="link" href="GISelectionFilters.html#A1">Selection</a> 
 in the menu bar.</p>
<p><img src="GI_grow.png" /> <b>Grow:</b> This filter performs a morphological 
 dilatation of the current selection, i.e., the selection is made bigger by
 one pixel in every direction. The filter can be applied to the current 
 slice only (shortcut is Ctrl +), to all slices (orientation is defined by 
 the active viewer), or to the whole volume. You can access this command 
 also though the item <a class="link" href="GISelectionFilters.html#A1">Selection</a> in the menu bar.
