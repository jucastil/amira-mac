<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
 The <em>Color Dialog</em> provides an interface for selecting colors. It
 pops up whenever a single color is to be changed in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>. The dialog
 provides several different interface components: a menu bar, color
 sliders, default color cells, a color picker, and five buttons.</p>

 </div>
<p> The menu bar allows you to set some options for working with the color
 dialog. The sliders (and the corresponding text fields and arrow
 buttons) let you choose a color by hue, saturation, and value (HSV), or
 by the levels of red, green, and blue (RGB). The color picker allows
 you to pick a color by sight. Moreover, you can choose a predefined
 color from a palette of custom colors cells. The buttons are used to
 apply or reset changes and to quit the dialog. A detailed description
 of the interface components is given below.</p>
<p> <b>Menu Bar:</b> The menu bar holds two popup menus: the <em>Edit</em> and
 the <em>Options</em> menu. There are two items in the <em>Edit</em> menu allowing
 you to toggle between different editing modes: the <em>Immediate
 Mode</em> and <em>WYSIWYG Mode</em>.</p>
<p> If <em>Immediate Mode</em> is selected, each modification of the color to
 be changed is effective immediately, e.g., if you are changing the
 background color of the 3D viewer and <em>Immediate Mode</em> is active,
 the effect of every slider or picker operation can be observed directly
 in the viewer.</p>
<p> The <em>WYSIWYG Mode</em> (meaning <em>what you see is what you get</em>)
 determines the background of the color sliders. If <em>WYSIWYG Mode</em>
 is active, the background of a slider shows a color range representing
 how the current color would change by moving this slider.</p>
<p> You have the option of displaying and manipulating two different
 combinations of sliders: RGB and HSV. The <em>Options</em> menu holds two items
 representing these two combinations. Selecting <em>RGB Sliders</em>
 provides controls over RGB color space. Selecting <em>HSV sliders</em>
 provides sliders to manipulate the HSV color space.</p>
<p> <b>Color Sliders:</b> The color sliders present the color range in hue,
 saturation, value (HSV) or red, green, blue (RGB) color spaces. If the
 color to be changed has an alpha component, an additional slider is
 automatically displayed. Each slider controls one color component. The
 color sliders are visible depending on the user selection in the <em>Options</em>
 menu. Each of the color sliders is accompanied by a text edit field
 to view the exact value of the current color component and to set its
 numerical value. The component values are always in the range from 0 to
 1. </p>
<p> On the left side of each slider (except the alpha slider) an additional
 check button is displayed allowing you to select one color
 component to control the appearance and functionality of the color
 picker.</p>
<p> <b>Color Cells:</b> The color cells are subdivided into three different
 groups: One cell named <em>Current Color</em> displays the color depending
 on the current settings. Each color manipulation is shown by this cell
 immediately. The cell named <em>Old Color</em> displays the original color
 the dialog has been invoked with. The old color does not change until
 current setting are applied by activating the <em>Apply</em> button. The
 other cells labeled <em>Custom Colors</em> provide a user-defined palette
 for storing colors. The custom colors stay resident between successive
 color dialog popups. </p>
<p> The <em>Drag and Drop mechanism</em> is applied to store and restore
 colors. The colors can be copied arbitrarily between all cells (except
 that a color cannot be stored to the old color cell). To drag and
 drop a color
 </p>
<ol><li>move your mouse cursor on top of a color cell (source),</li><li>press down on the left mouse button and keep it pressed,</li><li>move your mouse cursor on top of another cell (destination),</li><li>release the mouse button.</li>
</ol>
<p> <b>Buttons:</b> The four buttons named <em>OK</em>, <em>Apply</em>, <em>Reset</em> and <em>Cancel</em> are for quitting the dialog and applying the
 changes to the underlying color (OK), applying the changes without
 quitting (Apply), resetting the current color to the old color, i.e.
 discarding last changes (Reset), and quitting the dialog without
 applying the changes (Cancel). The fifth button named <em>Help</em> is for
 displaying this documentation in the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> help window.</p>
<p> <b>Color Picker:</b> The Color Picker provides visual selection of a
 color. Depending on the selected color component (selecting using the radio
 button on the left side of each slider), the two other components of the
 color can be set with the picker. One component corresponds to the
 vertical extent of the color picker and the other to the horizontal.
 The selected component cannot be changed with the picker. To select a
 color using the color picker
 </p>
<ol><li>Move your mouse cursor on top of the color picker.</li><li>Press down on the left mouse button and move your mouse. While
 moving the mouse around the current color is set to the color
 at the mouse position.</li><li>Release the mouse when you are done.</li>
