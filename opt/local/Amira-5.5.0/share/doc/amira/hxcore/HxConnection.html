<h3>Description</h3>

<p> This port represents a connection from one object to another. It is
 commonly used to specify on which input objects some other object
 should depend. A connection does not provide its own user interface
 like other ports, but is visually represented in the Pool by a
 line between the source object and the object the connection port
 belongs to. In order to change the connection this line can be picked
 with the mouse and dragged to some other source object. All connection
 ports of an object are listed in a special popup menu which is activated
 by clicking with the right mouse button in the connection area, the
 small white square on the left side of the object's icon.</p>
