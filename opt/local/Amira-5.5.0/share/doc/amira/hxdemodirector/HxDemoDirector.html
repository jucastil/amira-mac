<p></p><div class="hxdescription">
<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Using the <i>DemoMaker</i> module together with the <i>DemoDirector</i>
GUI, you can create an animated sequence of operations, e.g., for
automatically running demonstrations or for advanced movie
recording. Select <i>Create &rarr; Animation/Demos &rarr; DemoMaker</i> from the menu
to add a DemoMaker module to the Pool. The DemoDirector's user
interface shares the space with the console window of
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font>. You can switch between DemoDirector and the console
window by clicking on the respective text in the console area's frame.</p>

<h3><a name="A2">Defining and storing a demo sequence</a></h3>
<p>The demo sequence is a set of <i>events</i> over a time range
represented by the DemoDirector's timeline. A wide range of such
events can be defined, e.g., switching a toggle value on or off,
varying the numerical value of some other module's port over time, and
defining breaks to interrupt the automatic demo sequence.</p>
<p>The start and end time of a demo are depicted by blue lines which
restrict the timeline left and right. The "current time" of the demo
is visualized with a red line. All three elements can be moved with
the mouse.</p>
<p>You can create new events using the <em>New event</em> dialog, which is
accessible via the <i>New event...</i> button in the DemoDirector
area. After clicking the button a dialog window appears which contains
a tree view. The tree view shows all currently loaded modules (except
the DemoMaker itself) at the first level and the available events for
each module at the second and third level. You choose a new event
either by selecting it and clicking on the <em>Ok</em> button or by
double-clicking the event. If necessary the list of the currently
available events will be refreshed at invocation of the dialog. This
may take a few seconds if the pool contains many modules. You can also
trigger refreshing the list manually by clicking the <em>Update event
 list</em> button. Such a manual update is necessary, e.g., after changing
the viewer layout in order to get correct viewer mask entries in the
event list.</p>
<p>Once you have selected the right element (or a different event type
like a pause, break, go-to, or an arbitrary Tcl command) from the <i>New event</i> dialog, a new event is created at the current time's
position and additional ports will show up in the Properties area,
depending on the type of the selected element (e.g., numeric, toggle,
button, ...). Using these ports, you can define the value to which the
selected GUI element will be set at that time (see
<a class="link" href="#A7">example</a> below).</p>
<p>Once a part of the desired event sequence is defined, simply store it
by choosing <i>File/Save Network...</i> from the menu. The demo in its
current state will be saved along with the rest of the Pool. When
saving the network, make sure the current time slider is in the
desired starting position.</p>

<h3><a name="A3">Working with events</a></h3>
<p>You can select an event by clicking on it with the mouse. Selected
events are marked with a blue border. All values of the currently
selected event are displayed in the Properties area and can be changed
there.</p>
<p>If you hover over an event for a short time you will see a tooltip
with all the event's relevant information.</p>
<p>You can change the point in time at which an event should be triggered
by moving the event with the mouse horizontally within the
timeline. Whenever the event is close to another event it jumps to the
other one's trigger time and snaps. Snapped events are marked with red
lines. Snapping can be disabled by pressing the Shift key while moving
events.</p>
<p>The starting time and end time of events depicting a duration can be
changed in the same way. The mouse cursor alters its shape in order to
indicate whether the whole event would be moved or the starting time
or the end time. </p>
<p>Multiple events can be selected with a selection rectangle. The
starting point of a selection rectangle is determined by pressing the
left mouse button within the timeline (but not in the scale area, see
below). The rectangle is then created by moving the mouse while
keeping the mouse button pressed. After releasing the mouse button all
events inside the rectangle are selected. With the Ctrl key pressed
the newly selected events are added to the existing
selection. Otherwise previously selected events are
deselected. Individual events can be added to or removed from the
selection by clicking on them while the Ctrl key is pressed.</p>
<p>The left and right border of interval events can be selected
separately. Event borders can be added to a selection or removed from a
selection just as described above.</p>
<p>The timeline can be moved by pressing the left mouse button at the
scale area and then moving the mouse. Furthermore, the timeline is
moved automatically whenever an event reaches the timeline window's
left or right border while moving it.</p>
<p>The vertical positioning of events is calculated
automatically. Recalculation is done whenever two events overlap each
other. In all other cases the arrangement will not change automatically
in order to not confuse the user. Rearranging can be triggered by
clicking with the right mouse button at the timeline's
background. This can be useful to condense the events in the timeline
after major changes or after zooming in. Zooming can be done with the
buttons labeled <em>+</em> and <em>-</em></p>

<h3><a name="A4">Deleting events</a></h3>
<p>Selected events can be deleted by either pressing the Del key or using
the context menu, which is accessible by pressing the right mouse
button on an event.</p>
<p><a name="A5"></a>
</p>
<h3><a name="A6">Playing a demo sequence</a></h3>
<p>Playing a demo sequence can be controlled with the buttons below the
timeline:</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><p>
<a href=hxdemodirector-controls.png.html><img width=375 src="hxdemodirector-controls.png" /></a>
</p></div>
<p>For playing the demo, simply press the play button (triangle pointing
to the right) or press the corresponding function key <tt>F4</tt>. The
sequence will run from the current time step to the end of the demo,
or to the next break as defined by the user (see
<a class="link" href="#A17">Defining a break</a> below). The play button
will change into a stop button, and pressing that button or pressing
the <tt>F3</tt> function key immediately stops playing. If the demo stops
at a user-defined break, continue it by again clicking the play button
or pressing <tt>F4</tt>.</p>
<p>If the demo is stopped at the beginning or at some user-defined break,
you can jump to the point of the next break, or to the end of the demo
by clicking on the play button while the Ctrl key is pressed (or use
the function key <tt>F10</tt>).</p>
<p>Similarly, clicking on the play backward button while the Ctrl key is
pressed (or the function key <tt>F9</tt>) jumps to the previous break or to
the very beginning of the event sequence. Once you have jumped to the
right step of the demo, simply press play or <tt>F4</tt> again to play it
from there.</p>
<p>If you press the jump right button (triangle pointing to the right
together with a vertical line at its tip) the current time slider
jumps to the end of the demo. If you hold down the Ctrl key while
clicking the button, the slider jumps to the rightmost event, and with
the Shift key pressed the timeline jumps to the right boundary without
changing the current time slider's position. The jump left button
works correspondingly.</p>
<p>Press the step forward button (triangle pointing to the right together
with a vertical line at its base) to step one time step forward.</p>
<p>If the event sequence is running too fast or too slow, you can adjust
its speed using the <i>Configure</i> dialog, accesible through the
rightmost button (with the small rectangle). Note that the playback
speed can only be adjusted for the complete time range at once. If you
want to change the speed of only a part of the sequence, you must do
so by adjusting the time range of the corresponding event entries.</p>
<p><a name="A7"></a>
</p>
<h3><a name="A8">Usage Example</a></h3>
<p>Here is a small example to demonstrate the way <i>DemoMaker</i> works.</p>
<p>Load <tt>lobus.am</tt> from the <tt>tutorials</tt> subdirectory of the
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> installation directory. Connect an <i>OrthoSlice</i>
module and an <i>Isosurface</i> module. Create a <i>DemoMaker</i> by
selecting it from the <i>Create/Animation/Demo</i> menu.</p>
<p>Now your network should look similar to this:</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><p>
<a href=HxDemoDirector_example.png.html><img width=525 src="HxDemoDirector_example.png" /></a>
</p></div>
<p>All available user interface ports of the modules in the Pool should
now appear in the <i>New event</i> dialog (accessible via
DemoDirector's <em>New event...</em> button). If not, press the <i>Update event list</i> button.</p>
<p>Now select <i>OrthoSlice/Slice Number</i> in the
dialog:</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><p>
<a href=HxDemoDirector_example01.png.html><img width=412 src="HxDemoDirector_example01.png" /></a>
</p></div>
<p>Fields for specifying start/end values and start/end time
appear. Enter <tt>0</tt> and <tt>43</tt> as start and end values and move
the event with the mouse to position <tt>5</tt> and adjust its end time
to <tt>30</tt>:</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><p>
<a href=HxDemoDirector_example02.png.html><img width=525 src="HxDemoDirector_example02.png" /></a>
</p></div>
<p>Press the play button to see the demo sequence just specified. You
should see the <i>OrthoSlice</i> plane moving during the time range
from 5 to 30, but nothing happening in the time range from 30 to
100.</p>
<p>Now select a threshold of 70 in the <i>Isosurface</i> module and
press <i>Apply</i> to make the surface appear in the viewer. </p>
<p>Now select <i>Isosurface/Viewer mask/Viewer 0</i> from the <i>New
 event</i> dialog, select <i>on</i> as the toggle value and move the
event to <tt>30</tt> to determine its trigger
time:</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><p>
<a href=HxDemoDirector_example03.png.html><img width=525 src="HxDemoDirector_example03.png" /></a>
</p></div>
<p>Jump back to <tt>0</tt> by clicking on the jump left button. You should
see that when jumping back (from later than 30 to earlier than 30) the
<i>Isosurface</i> is switched off. Then play the demo from the
beginning, and you see that the surface is switched on right after the
OrthoSlice is moved.</p>
<p>As another exercise you can create a camera path (select <i>Create/CameraPath</i> or <i>Create/CameraRotate</i> from the menu and
edit the camera path to your liking. Then select <i>CameraPath/Time</i>
or <i>CameraRotate/Time</i> in the <i>New event</i> dialog. Now the
start/end value refers to the value of the camera time slider. Enter
the minimum and maximum values of that time slider. Move the event's
start and endpoint to 5 and 30:</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><p>
<a href=HxDemoDirector_example04.png.html><img width=525 src="HxDemoDirector_example04.png" /></a>
</p></div>
<p>Now you see that in parallel to the events defined before, the camera
path is applied to the scene. Note that you can execute only parts of
a camera path, or concatenate multiple paths this way. However,
multiple camera paths cannot be used in parallel.</p>

<h3><a name="A9">Loading existing networks</a></h3>
<p>The way <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> stores DemoMaker objects in network files
changed slightly in order to incorporate the DemoDirector. Old
network files are converted automatically to the new format, but saved
networks cannot be used with older versions of <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>.</p>
<p>The DemoDirector is always connected to a single DemoMaker
object. When a network is loaded which contains more than one
DemoMaker, the other DemoMakers act as in previous versions of
<font face="helvetica">Amira</font> (see <a class="link" href="../scriptobjects/DemoMaker.html#A1">DemoMakerClassic</a>
documentation). But it is reasonable to only use one DemoMaker and
 merge all events from other DemoMakers.</p>
<p>For this purpose the events have first to be exported from the other
DemoMakers. This is done by enabling the <em>options</em> toggle in the
<em>Functions</em> row and then using the <em>SaveEventList</em> button in
the <em>Options (advanced)</em> row (in the properties area). A proper
file name can be set before in the row <em>Event list file</em>. The
created event list can then be imported into the DemoDirector's
DemoMaker in the same way. Using the <em>LoadEvenList</em> replaces all
existing events, using <em>AppendEventList</em> keeps them.</p>

<p>

When selecting <i>*Tcl command</i> from the <i>New event</i> dialog, you
can insert arbitrary Tcl commands into the demo sequence. Furthermore,

<h3>Commands</h3>
<p>
The following commands are methods of the <i>DemoMaker</i> script
object. They can be called externally by first specifying the name of
the script object (e.g. DemoMaker), followed by a space and the name
of the method. Example: <tt>DemoMaker play</tt> starts playing the
demo sequence.</p>

<div class="hxcommand">
  <span class="headline">play</span>  

<div class="body"><p>start playing the time slider at its current

</div></div>
<div class="hxcommand">
  <span class="headline">stop</span>  

<div class="body"><p>stop playing the time slider. This function is called

</div></div>
<div class="hxcommand">
  <span class="headline">jump &lt;breakidx&gt;</span>  

<div class="body"><p>jump to user-defined break. If <tt>&lt;breakidx&gt;</tt>

<p>

Although the <i>DemoMaker</i> module is quite powerful, some things
should be noticed, and there are some known limitations that are
listed here for convenience. If you find further important limitations
or bugs, please report them to our hotline as a bug or feature request.</p>

<ul><li>The <i>*Load network</i> event type for loading a different
network file is currently not implemented.</li><li>For <i>button event</i>, "snapping" a button to
automatic update mode is not supported yet.</li><li>GUI elements that are part of a <a class="link" href="../hxcore/HxPortGeneric.html#A1">Generic
port</a> are not properly represented in the <i>New event</i> dialog
of the DemoDirector.</li><li>If a <i>DemoMaker</i> module is renamed (e.g. by selecting
<i>Edit / Rename...</i> from the menu), the function keys
<tt>F3/F4/F9/F10</tt> will no longer work. However, simply disabling
and re-enabling the <i>function keys</i> option in
<i>DemoMaker</i> helps.</li><li>If you rename or remove modules after defining events with
<i>DemoMaker</i>, then events involving these modules will generate
errors. Please properly arrange your network before using DemoMaker.</li><li>You cannot control DemoMaker/DemoDirector with a GlobalTime
object (in order to synchronize several objects). As a workaround
you can control the time ports of these objects by adding them
to the DemoDirector.</li>
