<h2><a name="A1">10.3 Molecular Data Structures</a></h2>
<p>Several molecular file formats including, for example, PDB, Tripos,
and UniChem, can be read and written by <font face="helvetica">Molecular Option</font>, other file formats,
such as CHARMM, can only be read. The information read from the data
files will be stored in different types of objects: <em>Molecule</em>,
<em>MolTrajectory</em>, and <em>MolTrajectoryBundle</em>.</p>
<p><b>Molecule.</b> Single molecular configurations are represented as
data objects of type <a class="link" href="HxMolecule.html#A1">Molecule</a>. This kind of object
can either be created by loading a file containing a single molecular
structure or by attaching it to an object of type
<a class="link" href="HxMolTrajectory.html#A1">MolTrajectory</a>, in which case it will act as a
projector, extracting one of the trajectory's 'time steps', i.e., a
single structure.</p>
<p><b>Trajectory.</b> The <a class="link" href="HxMolTrajectory.html#A1">MolTrajectory</a> data
structure represents a series of molecular configurations of the same
molecule. Again two cases are possible. Either the trajectory is
loaded directly from a file. Or it can be attached to an object of
type <em>MolTrajectoryBundle</em>, extracting one of the trajectories
contained in that bundle.</p>
<p><b>Bundle of trajectories.</b> A trajectory bundle reflects the case
of a file containing more than one molecular trajectory. If such a
file is loaded into <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>, an object of type <em>MolTrajectoryBundle</em> will be created. A single trajectory can be
accessed by attaching a <a class="link" href="HxMolTrajectory.html#A1">MolTrajectory</a> object.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A2">10.3.1 Internal Structure of Molecules</a></h3>
<p>An object of data type <a class="link" href="HxMolecule.html#A1">Molecule</a> contains
information about the structure of a molecule and the atomic
coordinates of one of its configurations. The mandatory part of
structural information concerns the number and types of all atoms
contained in the molecule. All the topological information is
organized in levels which are cliques of groups. Each group contains
other groups or atoms. The simplest example is the level <em>bonds</em>,
which consists of groups of two atoms.</p>
<p>Some levels can build hierarchies. For example, a residue consists of
a number of atoms, and a couple of residues may form a secondary
structure. These levels and groups can be defined by file readers or
interactively via <a class="link" href="HxMolecule.html#A10">Tcl commands</a>.</p>
