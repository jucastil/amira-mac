<h3><a name="A1">10.1.1 Getting Started with Molecular Visualization</a></h3>
<p>In this section you will learn how to</p>
<p></p>
<ol><li>load a molecular demo data set into <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>,</li><li>view the molecule with the <em>MoleculeView</em> display module,</li><li>try out various color schemes,</li><li>select atoms in the viewer using the draw tool,</li><li>overwrite color scheme colors for selected atoms.</li>
</ol><p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A2">10.1.1.1 Loading Data into the System</a></h4>
<p>In the following introduction we will consider a simple example to
explain the basic functions of the <a class="link" href="../hxmolview/HxMolView.html#A1">MoleculeView</a>
module. Our example will be a small PDB (Protein Data Bank) structure
consisting of 932 atoms in 213 residues.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Load the file <tt>2RNT.pdb</tt> into the Pool from the
 directory <tt>data/molecules/pdb</tt>.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>A green icon labeled <tt>2RNT.pdb</tt> will appear in the Pool.
The green icon represents an object of type
<a class="link" href="HxMolecule.html#A1">Molecule</a>. Click on the green data icon with the
left mouse button. In the Properties Area below the Pool
information about the molecule, such as the number of atoms etc., will
be shown. In addition, other ports named <em>Transformation</em>, <em>Selection Browser</em>, and <em>Transform</em>, can be seen; they will be
explained in later tutorials.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A3">10.1.1.2 Displaying the Molecule with the MoleculeView Module</a></h4>
<p>The <em>MoleculeView</em> module is the basic display module for
visualizing molecules. It allows you to display atoms as plates or
balls and bonds as lines or cylinders.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Click again on the green data icon in the Pool, this time
 using the right mouse button.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>A menu, containing several entries and submenus, will appear.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Select the entry <em>MoleculeView</em>.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>A new yellow icon labeled <em>MoleculeView</em> appears in the 
Pool. Yellow icons, in general, represent display modules, i.e.,
modules that visualize objects in the viewer. The blue line between
the icons indicates a connection between the objects. In this case the
MoleculeView module reads data from the object represented by the green icon
and visualizes it.</p>
<p>The molecule is now displayed in the viewer as a wireframe. Using the
left mouse button you can rotate the object; using the left and middle
mouse buttons simultaneously you can zoom in and out. For these mouse
operations to work, the viewer must be in <em>viewing mode</em>, in which
case the mouse cursor is displayed as a hand.</p>
<p>Whenever the MoleculeView module is active, the little square on the
yellow <tt>MoleculeView</tt> icon is orange. You can deactivate the
module by clicking on the square with the left mouse button.</p>
<p>We will explore some basic ports of the MoleculeView module.<br />

<em>Mode port:</em> Choose another mode to see both atoms and bonds of
the molecule, or just atoms. If atoms are shown, use the <em>Atom
 Radius</em> port to adjust the size of the atoms as desired.<br />

<em>Quality port:</em> If you choose the option <em>correct</em>, you can
display a correct, i.e. three-dimensional, image of the balls and
sticks. Consider the trade-off between correct representation and
slower rendering performance. Use the <em>fast</em> mode if you want to
display a large molecule. If your graphics hardware is fast enough,
you can use the <em>correct</em> mode even for
large molecules.<br />

<em>Complexity port:</em> In order to allow interactive rendering, the
default complexity of the scene is rather low. In most cases this will
be sufficient. However, if you want to make screen shots or if you
have small molecules, you might want to increase the complexity. The
<em>Complexity</em> port is displayed only if <em>correct</em> quality is
selected.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A4">10.1.1.3 Changing the Color Scheme</a></h4>
<p>The MoleculeView module allows the user to color the molecule
according to levels, for example, atom level, residue level, secondary
structure level, chain level, or user-defined levels. Each level has a
number of attributes, the simplest of which is the <em>index</em>
attribute. The default color scheme is to color the molecule according
to the atom level's attribute <em>atomic_number</em>, i.e., the atom's
type.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Click the <em>Legend</em> button of the <em>Color</em> port to
 display a small window decoding the colors you see in the viewer
 window.</li><li>Choose <em>residues</em> from the first pop-up menu and <em>type</em>
 from the second menu to color the molecule according to the residue
 type, here the amino acid type.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>The default colormap contains a constant color. Thus, currently all
residues of the molecule have the same color.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>To change the colormap, right-click on the color bar of the
 <em>Discrete CM</em> port which has appeared below the <em>Color</em> port
 and select any other colormap.</li><li>Try out different colormaps to find a map that suits your
 purposes.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Some people prefer the <em>CPK</em> color scheme for atoms and the amino
acid colors as they are used in the <em>RasMol</em> program.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>You can set your preferences in the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> <em>Edit</em> menu by
 selecting the entry <em>Preferences</em>.</li><li>Press the <em>Molecules</em> tab and set your preferences. Pressing
 the <em>OK</em> button saves your preferences permanently.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Currently only amino acid colors are predefined. Thus, if the molecule
contains residues other than the standard amino acids, those residues
will be colored with the default color (black).</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A5">10.1.1.4 Using the Draw Tool</a></h4>
<p>The draw tool appears in <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> in several modules. It enables you to
select objects or parts of an object by drawing a line in the viewer.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Press the <em>Draw</em> button of the <em>Highlighting</em> port and
 draw a line in the viewer window around the group of atoms you want
 to select.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>The atoms that were enclosed by the line will be highlighted. If the
viewer is the active window, pressing the <tt>d</tt> key is equivalent to
pressing the <em>Draw</em> button of the <em>Highlighting</em> port.
</p>
<ul><li>To unhighlight all atoms, press the <em>Clear</em> button
 of the <em>Highlighting</em> port.</li><li>Also try using the keys <tt>Ctrl</tt> and <tt>Shift</tt> while drawing
 a line.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A6">10.1.1.5 Setting Colors for Selected Parts</a></h4>
<p>The <em>Define Colors</em> port allows you to overwrite colors of the
color scheme.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Select some atoms using the draw tool.</li><li>Press the <em>Set</em> button of the <em>Define Color</em> port.</li><li>Change the current color of the <a class="link" href="../hxcore/QxColorDialog.html#A1">Color
 Editor</a> and press <em>OK</em>.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>The previously highlighted atoms should now have the color
selected in the color editor. This setting will be preserved even if
the color scheme is changed. Unfortunately, the new setting will
currently not appear in the color legend.</p>
