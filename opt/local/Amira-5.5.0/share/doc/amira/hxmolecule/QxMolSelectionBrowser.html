<h2><a name="A1">1 Molecule Selection Browser</a></h2>
<p>The selection browser is a handy tool for investigating
 the topology of a molecule. It
 consists of three main parts: the menu bar, a scroll window, and a
 highlighting section. In the scroll window all items of a chosen
 level will be displayed. Most of the pop-up menus in the menu bar
 allow you to control what is being shown in the scroll
 window. Finally, the highlighting section provides further
 functionality for the selection of items in the scroll window.</p>
<p> The selection browser enables you to quickly select parts of
 the molecule, which will then be highlighted in the browser as
 well as in the viewer by the display modules connected to the
 molecule. The highlighting allows a correlation between the topology 
 and the molecule's three-dimensional structure to be
 established. Highlighted atoms can be used for masking. Thus, you
 can concentrate on specific regions of interest. Furthermore, 
 masking allows different representations to be combined quickly and 
 easily.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A2">1.1 The Scroll Window</a></h3>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A3">1.1.1 Displayed information</a></h4>
<p>In this window all items of a chosen level are displayed
 hierarchically in the first column. An item might consist of a
 single atom or a group of items. </p>
<p> If there is additional information for an item, it will be
 displayed in the following columns. If the information is not
 available, the entry will be empty. Additional information typically
 includes the item's type and the membership of the item in some
 level. Note that only the direct membership will be considered,
 i.e., if an item is not a member of some level, but a member of some
 group, that is an item of the level, the membership information will
 not be displayed. An exception is being made if <em>atoms</em> is chosen
 as the master level. In this case, <font face="helvetica">Molecular Option</font> displays all groups of the
 information level the atom belongs to.</p>
<p> If there are any display modules or other modules containing a
 filter connected to the molecule
 (<a class="link" href="moldisplay.html#A11">see introductory section on the
 display of molecules</a>), there will be more columns to the right of the
 info columns - one per module. These columns, which we will call <em>module columns</em>, are used to display whether an item is <em>in use</em>
 by a module. For each item a rectangle will be drawn in each <em>module column</em>. If the item is completely <em>in use</em> by a module,
 the rectangle contains a check mark. If it is partially <em>in use</em>,
 i.e. some but not all of its group items are <em>in use</em>, the check mark
 will be gray. There is one other symbol that might be displayed in
 the rectangle, a `B'. The `B' stands for backbone and indicates that
 the atom belongs to those atoms currently defined as the backbone. This
 will be described in the following subsections. The `B' might be black
 or gray. Again, gray means the atom is not <em>in use</em> by the
 module. A black letter indicates that the atom is <em>in use</em>, but
 simply because it belongs to the backbone.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A4">1.1.2 Item and information columns</a></h4>
<p>If an item is a group, i.e., it contains items, a little icon will be
 placed to the left of the item name. You can click on the icon to
 open/close the item, i.e., to show or hide the contained items,
 respectively. </p>
<p> In order to select an item in the scroll window, you can click on
 the respective item, which will be highlighted immediately. To toggle
 the selection of an item, you must <tt>Ctrl</tt>-click the item. When <tt>Shift</tt>-clicking an item a whole range will be selected. You can also
 drag the mouse with the left mouse button pressed over a range of
 items which selects all of them. <tt>Ctrl</tt>-click and drag again
 toggles the selection. If an item is fully selected, it will be
 highlighted in red. If at least one but not all of its subitems are
 selected, <font face="helvetica">Molecular Option</font> considers the item to be partially selected and
 highlights it in green.</p>
<p> It is also possible to select items by type or 
 other information in the information columns. If you click on
 the displayed information for an item, all items with the same
 information will also be selected.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A5">1.1.3 Module columns</a></h4>
<p>If there are any modules containing a filter connected to the
 molecule, such as <a class="link" href="../hxmolview/HxMolView.html#A1">MoleculeView</a>,
 <a class="link" href="../hxmolview/HxSecStructure.html#A1">SecStructureView</a>,
 <a class="link" href="../hxmolsurface/HxCompMolSurface.html#A1">CompMolSurface</a>, or
 <a class="link" href="../hxmolsurface/HxMolSurfaceView.html#A1">MolSurfaceView</a> there will be module columns
 in addition to the master and information columns - one per 
 module. Each of these columns contains a check box for each item
 displayed. The check box contains information about whether an item is
 <em>in use</em> by a module or not. Before the different states of a check
 box are explained, we will make a short side trip. For convenience, all
 atoms are classified as belonging to the backbone or not. You can
 restrict your selection to
 only backbone atoms, which means that an atom will only be <em>used</em>
 by the module if it belongs to the backbone. Apart from that you may
 also want to <em>use</em> at least all backbone atoms plus additional
 atoms. Therefore, internally there are two arrays, one containing
 all backbone atoms and one containing so-called <em>selected</em>
 atoms. Depending on the backbone mode, there are three choices:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>all atoms contained in either array will be <em>used</em>, or</li><li>all atoms contained in both arrays will be <em>used</em>, or</li><li>only those atoms contained in the <em>selected</em> array will be
 <em>used</em>.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p> Using those two arrays allows you to quickly change between
 backbone atoms and all others without losing the previous atom
 masking.</p>
<p> Now let's go back to the check box states. There are five
 different states of a check box, including one state with two
 different meanings. </p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>The box is empty: the complete item is not shown by the viewer.</li><li>The box contains a black check mark: the complete item is shown.</li><li>The box contains a gray check mark and the item is an atom: the atom
 is a member of the <em>selected</em> array, but is still not shown due to the
 backbone mode, i.e., it does not belong to the backbone.</li><li>The box contains a gray check mark and the item is not an atom: the
 item is only partially shown in the viewer.</li><li>The box contains a black `B' (only for atoms): the atom is
 shown simply because it belongs to the backbone.</li><li>The box contains a gray `B' (only for atoms): the atom is not
 shown, but belongs to the backbone.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p> Clicking on a box toggles its state. You can also click on one item
 and then drag the mouse pointer over multiple items. All of these
 items will be set to the same state as the first item.</p>
<p> In addition to directly clicking on a box, there is another way
 to change the state of the check boxes. If you click on the header of a
 module column with the right mouse button, a pop-up menu will appear
 containing the following entries: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Add: adds the currently highlighted atoms to the
 `selected' array.</li><li>Remove: removes the highlighted atoms from the selection.</li><li>Replace: replaces selection by highlighted atoms.</li><li>Clear: clears the `selected' array.</li><li>All: selects all atoms.</li><li>Restrict to: this pop-up menu allows you to restrict the
 set of displayed atoms to some predefined set.</li><li>Combine with: if one of the entries in this pop-up menu is
 selected, the chosen set will be the minimum set that is being
 displayed by the respective display module.</li><li>Set: the `selected' array is set to the chosen predefined set
 of atoms. Starting from this selection you can add or remove parts of
 the molecule.</li><li>Filter to selection: The highlighting in the molecule 
 is set to the active atoms in the module's filter.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A6">1.2 Highlighting Section</a></h3>
<p>This browser section consists of a text field and a button row. In the
 text field you can type 
 <a class="link" href="molatomexpressions.html#A1">atom expressions</a>. 
 The expressions you type will be saved in a history. Using
 the <tt>Up</tt> and <tt>Down</tt> keys you can go back to previous
 expressions. If you press the <tt>Return</tt> key, the current expression 
 will be used to replace the current highlighting, hence it is a short
 cut to pressing the <em>Replace</em> button (see below).</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A7">1.2.1 Buttons</a></h4>
<p>The buttons work in conjunction with the expression in
 the text field. When pressing any of the first three buttons, the atom
 expression will be evaluated, and the atoms corresponding to the
 expression will be <em>added to</em>, <em>removed from</em>, or <em>replace</em> 
 the highlighting, respectively. The last three buttons <em>clear</em> the
 highlighting, highlight <em>all</em> items, or <em>undo</em> the last change,
 respectively. There exist short cuts to all buttons, which work when 
 the <em>Expression</em> line has the focus. The short cuts are as follows:
 <tt>Ctrl-A</tt> for <em>Add</em>, <tt>Ctrl-R</tt> for <em>Remove</em>, 
 <tt>Ctrl-P</tt> for <em>Replace</em>, <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> for <em>Clear</em>, 
 <tt>Ctrl-L</tt> for <em>All</em>, and <tt>Ctrl-U</tt> for <em>UndoLast</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="A8">1.3 Menu Bar</a></h3>
<p>The menu bar contains a couple of pop-up menus which will be explained
 below.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A9">1.3.1 MasterLevel</a></h4>
<p>The <em>MasterLevel</em> menu contains all levels currently defined in the
 molecule's <a class="link" href="moldatastruct.html#A2">topology</a>. All groups of the
 current master level will be displayed in the scroll window. </p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A10">1.3.2 Options</a></h4>
<p>The <em>Options</em> menu allows you to quickly open and collapse
 items, i.e., to show and hide the items contained in other items.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A11">1.3.3 Info</a></h4>
<p>With the help of the <em>Info</em> menu, you can display additional
 information columns, such as type, index, or the item's membership in
 a group of some level.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A12">1.3.4 Modules</a></h4>
<p>If you have many display modules connected to the molecule, the large 
 number of columns might be confusing. If you are only working with one or
 a few of the display modules, you might want to hide the other
 columns. This can be done with the help of this menu.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="A13">1.3.5 Highlighting</a></h4>
<p>By default, all display modules that allow highlighting will highlight
 all selected atoms. The <em>Highlighting</em> menu enables you to
 turn highlighting for each display module on and off.
