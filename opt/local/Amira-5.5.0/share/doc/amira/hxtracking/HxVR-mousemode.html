<h3><a name="A1">11.7.6 The 2D Mouse mode</a></h3>
<p>The 2D mouse mode is useful for accessing GUI elements which have no direct
analogy in 3D. In this mode the position of the ordinary 2D mouse pointer
is controlled using the 3D input device.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>In order to activate 2D mouse mode press the red <em>mouse mode</em>
 button of the 3D menu. Once mouse mode is activated the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> main
 window is popped up automatically.</li><li>You can control the 2D mouse by translating or rotating the 3D input
 device. Usually, rotating it is more convenient since less movement
 is required. The position of the 2D mouse is computed by determining
 the intersection of the virtual wand vector with the screen.</li><li><p>In order to exit 2D mouse mode, double-click the 3D input device over
 some insensitive region of the 2D user interface. When leaving 2D mouse
 mode the main graphics window is raised automatically.</p>
<p> If the 2D mouse stays in the middle of the screen, of course 3D
 impression is disturbed. Therefore, usually it is a good idea to move
 the 2D mouse in a corner before returning to 3D mode.</p></li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>The two Tcl procedures <em>VRSettings_StartMouseMode</em> and <em>VRSettings_StopMouseMode</em> are called when entering and exiting 2D mouse mode.
You can use these methods for example to pop up the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> help browser
with a page from which additional demos can be launched. For this, the
following definition could be included for example in the file
<em>$<tt>AMIRA_ROOT</tt>/share/resources/<font face="helvetica">Amira</font>/<font face="helvetica">Amira</font>.init</em>:</p>
<p><tt>  proc VRSettings\_StartMouseMode { } {</tt> <br />

<tt>    global </tt><tt>AMIRA_ROOT</tt> <br />

<tt>    load $</tt><tt>AMIRA_ROOT</tt><tt>/share/usersguide/tracking.html</tt> <br />

<tt>  }</tt></p>
<p>In order to activate or deactivate the 2D mouse mode from Tcl, the <font face="helvetica">Virtual Reality Option</font>
control module provides the command <tt>VRSettings enableMouseMode &lt;value&gt;</tt>,
where <tt>&lt;value&gt;</tt> can be either 0 or 1. In order to check if 2D mouse 
mode is currently active, you can use <tt>VRSettings isMouseModeEnabled</tt>.</p>
