<h3><a name="A1">11.7.5 Tcl Event Procedures</a></h3>
<p>By default, <font face="helvetica">Virtual Reality Option</font> treats all buttons of a 3D mouse in the same way.
This allows you to operate the program even with a one-button mouse. In
order to make better use of a 3D input device with multiple buttons, you
can define special Tcl procedures which are called when a button is pressed
or released. If these procedures return the value 1, this indicates that
the event has been handled by the Tcl procedure and that it should not
be further processed by <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>. In particular, it then will not be send
to the Open Inventor scene graph. The following procedures can be defined:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><tt>vrButton0Press, vrButton1Press, ...</tt><br />

 These procedures are called when the button with the specified index
 is pressed. By redefining <tt>vrButton0Press</tt> you can overwrite the
 default interaction routine.</li><li><tt>vrButton0Release, vrButton1Release, ...</tt><br />

 These procedures are called when the button with the specified index
 is released.</li><li><tt>vrButton0DblClick, vrButton1DblClick, ...</tt><br />

 These procedures are called when the button with the specified index
 is double-clicked. Note that for the first click of a double-click
 event an ordinary button press event is generated.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>When a 3D mouse button event occurs and no appropriate Tcl event procedure
is defined or if this procedure returns 0, the event will be passed to
the current <font face="helvetica">Virtual Reality Option</font> event handler. The default event handler checks if the
3D menu or some other 3D widget has been clicked. If not, it sends the
event to the Open Inventor scene graph. Besides this default event handler
there are also other event handlers, namely handlers for managing the
different navigation modes (<i>examine</i> and <i>fly</i>). </p>
<p>If a 3D mouse button event was not handled by the current event handler,
finally the following Tcl procedures will be called, provided they are
defined:</p>
<p><font size="2"></font></p><pre>
 vrButton0PressFallback, vrButton1PressFallback, ...
 vrButton0ReleaseFallback, vrButton1ReleaseFallback, ...
 vrButton0DblClickFallback, vrButton1DblClickFallback, ...
</pre><p><font size="2">
</font></p>
<p>Assuming that the default event handler is active (the one which checks
the 3D menu and the Open Inventor scene graph), you can trigger certain
actions when the user clicks into empty space. By default, when this
happens one of the navigation mode handlers is activated. If you want to
disable this feature you can define a dummy <tt>vrButton0PressFallback</tt>
procedure which always returns 1.</p>
