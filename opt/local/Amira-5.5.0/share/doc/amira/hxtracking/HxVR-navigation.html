<h3><a name="A1">11.7.4 Navigation Modes</a></h3>
<p><font face="helvetica">Virtual Reality Option</font> supports two different navigation modes. The default mode is <em>scene manipulation</em>, i.e., the whole scene can be rotated and translated
using the 3D input device. This is done by clicking with the wand into some
empty or insensitive region in space, and then moving the wand while
keeping the button pressed. In this mode the whole scene remains stick
relative to the input device.</p>
<p>The second mode is <em>fly mode</em>. This mode can be activated by selecting
the second entry from the <em>Mode</em> port of the <font face="helvetica">VRSettings</font> control module
(either in the 2D or in the 3D user interface). In fly mode you can click
the 3D input device at some insensitive point, and then move it in any
direction. The vector from the point where the wand was clicked to the
current point defines a velocity vector which is used to modify the
position of the camera. The longer the vector, i.e., the more the wand is
shifted, the faster the camera is moving. In the same way the orientation
of the camera is modified by rotating the 3D wand. An incremental
rotational change is computed by comparing the current orientation which
the orientation at the point where the wand was clicked initially.
