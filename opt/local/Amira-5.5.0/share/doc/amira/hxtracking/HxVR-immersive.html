<h2><a name="A1">11.5 Immersive Configurations</a></h2>
<p>In <font face="helvetica">Virtual Reality Option</font> an immersive configuration differs from a flat screen
configuration mainly in the way the screens are described in the config
file. While for a flat screen configuration it was sufficient to specify
which part of a big 2D virtual screen was covered by each screen, for an
immersive configuration the true physical coordinates of the screens have
to be specified. Knowing the exact spatial arrangements of the screens
has the advantage that correct perspective views can be computed for all
screens, provided the 3D position of the observer is also known. In
particular, the different screens no longer need to be arranged in a
plane. Instead, the screens might be arranged perpendicular to each other
like in a <em>CAVE</em> or on a <em>Holobench</em>. In fact, <font face="helvetica">Virtual Reality Option</font> supports
any other oblique arrangement as well.</p>
<p>Since the 3D position of the observer need to be known in order to compute
correct perspective views, usually the observer's eye position is tracked in
an immersive environment. In <font face="helvetica">Virtual Reality Option</font> this so-called <em>head tracking</em> can
be achieved using a variety of different tracking systems. Instead of
accessing the tracking system directly an intermediate software layer is
used, namely the <em>trackd</em> software of Mechdyne. <em>trackd</em> runs as a
server, communicates with the tracking system, and stores the tracking
data in a shared-memory areas which then is read by <font face="helvetica">Virtual Reality Option</font>. Using a
second sensor not only the observer's eye position can be tracked, but
also the position of a virtual wand, i.e., a kind of pointing or
interaction device to be held in a hand. For large planar screen
configurations it sometimes also makes sense to use a virtual wand without
head tracking. The images then will always be computed for a fixed
observer's eye position and possible image flicker due to noise in the tracking data is
avoided, which is an advantage for 3D demonstrations in front of a larger
audience.</p>
<p>Obviously, immersive configurations are more difficult to setup than
flat screen configurations. Besides defining a suitable <font face="helvetica">Virtual Reality Option</font>
configuration file, also the tracking system and the <em>trackd</em> daemon
have to be properly initialized. Finally, the tracking system has to
be calibrated for use with <font face="helvetica">Virtual Reality Option</font>. In the following sections we first want
to present some example config files for common immersive environments. In
particular config files for a single-wall workbench, for a double-wall
Holobench, and for a four-sided CAVE shall be discussed. The process of
calibrating the tracking system and customizing 3D user interaction is
described in subsequent sections.</p>
