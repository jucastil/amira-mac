<h3><a name="A1">11.9.1 Tracker Emulator</a></h3>
<p>The <em>Tracker Emulator</em> provides emulation of a 3D positioning device with 
two spatial sensors and two buttons. To activate it, type the word <em>test</em>
into the tracker port of the <a class="link" href="HxTracking.html#A1"><font face="helvetica">VRSettings</font> control module</a> and press
the <em>connect</em> button. After that the user interface dialog of the tracker 
emulator appears.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the emulator emulates two spatial sensors designated as <em>sensor0</em> 
and <em>sensor1</em>. For each of these sensors the position is changeable by three sliders, 
one for each direction. Alternatively, as well as to reach positions of greater distance
than the sliders allow, one can type the values directly into the text entry fields to the 
right of the slider.</p>
<p>The sensor's rotation can be changed by selecting one of the main axes as the rotation axis and
then further adjusting the rotation angle around this axis using the slider or the entry 
field. To perform an additional rotation, simply select a different rotation axis and angle.
The rotations are performed cumulatively. The current rotation doesn't affect the orientation
of the main rotation axes. The rotation center is always the current sensor position.
To set the sensor's rotation to the initial unrotated state, press the <em>Reset</em> button.</p>
<p>In the buttons section one can toggle the emulated button's state. As long as the checkbox 
is checked, the emulated button is "down". If it's unchecked, the emulated button is "up".
