<h3><a name="A1">11.4.3 Example: A Tiled 4-channel 2x2 Monitor Configuration</a></h3>
<p>There are some interesting graphics workstations with two two-channel
graphics pipes. 
One example is the SGI Octane Fuel. With such a computer
four different monitors or projectors can be used. For some purposes it
is useful to have a single viewer subdivided into 2x2 parts and each
part being displayed by a different monitor. Such a configuration can
be easily created using <font face="helvetica">Virtual Reality Option</font>.</p>
<p>We assume that the graphics computer has two pipes with two channels each.
The two pipes are configured as two separate X11 screens, <tt>:0.0</tt> and
<tt>:0.1</tt>. The left and right part of each screen is output on the two
different channels of the particular pipe. Then the configuration files
looks as follows:</p>

        display         ":0.0"
        channelOrigin	0.5 0
        channelSize	0.5 1

    }
    SoScreen {
        name            "Lower left monitor"
        display         ":0.1"
        channelOrigin   0 0
        channelSize     0.5 1
        tileOrigin      0 0
        tileSize        0.5 0.5

    }
    SoScreen {

        display         ":0.1"
        channelOrigin	0.5 1
        channelSize	0.5 1
        tileOrigin      0.5 0
        tileSize        0.5 0.5

<h4><a name="A2">Multi-pipe rendering</a></h4>
<p>Since the two X11 screens <tt>:0.0</tt> and <tt>:0.1</tt> are driven by two
independent graphics pipes it makes sense to perform the rendering on these
pipes in parallel. This is done by assigning the corresponding screens two
different thread groups. </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Note that for all common current graphics
architectures it makes no sense to render multiple windows on the same
pipe in parallel. Typically, this even implies a significant performance
decrease. Therefore, here we use only two thread groups instead of four.</li><li>In order to actually activate parallel rendering <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> must be started
with the command line option <tt>-mt</tt>. Alternatively, the environment
variable <tt>AMIRA_MULTITHREAD</tt> &nbsp;can be defined.</li>
