<h3><a name="A1">11.7.3 3D Module Controls</a></h3>
<p>The 3D menu provides a button called <em>Modules</em>. Clicking on this button
brings up a list of all visible modules which currently exist in the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font>
Pool. Clicking on a module button brings up a 3D version of the
modules user interface. This 3D user interface looks very similar to the
2D user interface of the module which is normally shown in the Properties Area
of the <font face="helvetica">Amira</font> main window. An example of the 3D user interface of the
<em>SurfaceView</em> module is shown in Figure <a class="link" href="HxVR-menu.html#A2">66</a>.</p>
<p>The 3D user interface of every module can be moved independently from
each other like the main 3D menu itself. Again, this is done by picking the
header bar of the module's GUI. The GUI can be removed by clicking on the
red <em>close button</em> at the right side of the header bar. On the left
side an orange <em>viewer toggle</em> is displayed. As in the 2D interface
a display module can be switched on or off by toggling this button.</p>
<p>In 3D the ports of a module can be manipulated almost in the same way as
in 2D. The only remarkable difference is that text input is not possible
in 3D. Text fields with numerical values like the range of a colormap port
or the data window of an OrthoSlice module still can be changed using a
virtual slider. This is done by clicking into the text field with the
wand, and then moving the wand upwards or downwards while keeping the
button pressed. As a general rule, every active element shows a yellow 
frame when the wand is pointing on it, i.e., when it has input focus.</p>
