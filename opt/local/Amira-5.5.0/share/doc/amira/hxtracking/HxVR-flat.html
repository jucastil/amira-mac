<h2><a name="A1">11.4 Flat Screen Configurations</a></h2>
<p>A flat screen configuration consists of usually two or more screens forming
a bigger 2D virtual graphics window commonly called a <em>tiled display</em>
or <em>power wall</em>. Users can interact with the ordinary 2D mouse, i.e.,
mouse events in the different windows are translated and interpreted in the
2D virtual window. There is no need for a tracking system in case of a flat
screen configuration. For such a configuration the only options provided by
the <font face="helvetica">VRSettings</font> control module are for controlling stereo viewing. 
Besides standard OpenGL active stereo modes,
passive stereo modes can also be configured. In the most simple case this
is done by defining two full screen windows on two different channels, one
for the left eye view and one for the right eye view. This particular
configuration is illustrated in Figure <a class="link" href="HxVR-passive.html#A2">62</a>. Other
passive stereo configurations are possible too, e.g., a super-wide tiled
passive stereo configuration with four channels (left side left eye, left
side right eye, right side left eye, right side right eye), possibly with
an overlap region for soft-edge blending.</p>
<p>The main advantage of a flat screen configuration is its ease of use. There
is no need for a tracking system. Flat screen configurations are well
suited for presentations targeted to a larger audience, e.g. presentations
in a seminar room or in a lecture hall.</p>
<p>In the following we describe some common flat screen configurations in more
detail, namely a standard-resolution two-projector passive stereo
configuration, a super-wide two-projector mono configuration with soft-edge
blending, and a tiled 2x2 four-channel monitor configuration. For some
cases also hardware solutions are available, namely special-purpose video
splitters converting an interlaced active stereo signal into separate
non-interlaced left eye and right eye signals for the passive stereo case,
or hardware edge-blending units for blended super-wide configurations.
However, these hardware solutions are usually expensive and less flexible.
Therefore they are often not suitable for temporary demonstrations or
experiments. 
We also illustrate below use of multi-pipe or cluster systems.</p>
