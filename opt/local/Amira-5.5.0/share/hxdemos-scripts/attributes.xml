In this file all attributes and their possible values are listed that can
be used in the <attributes>-section in a specific description.xml-file.
<attribute type="version" values="zib-2006-2" /> means that the demo
is successfully tested against the zib-2006-2-release
In each demo file, a section like the following should be added
the values="" contains a comma separated list (don't use spaces)
<attributes>
      <attribute name="display" values="normal" />
      <attribute name="version" values="zib-2006-2" />
      <attribute name="topic" values="flow" />
      <attribute name="state" values="released" />
</attributes>

Order of attributes and their values in the comma separated list matter:
- the order will be respected in the DemoGUI display
- the default setting in the demo-gui can be set by attribute default

An attribute can either allow or forbid to select all values
select-any="yes" means that no value has to be specified for the given attribute when selecting demos. Then all demos match
select-any="no" means that a value has to be specified for the given attribute when selecting demos

The attribute "state" is currently the only attribute that has to be explicitly specified
There, "released" is the default setting. This means that all demos that 
do not provide a type="state" attribute or with value="experimental" will not
be seen in the default view of the DemoGUI.

Each attribute has a default value. this can be either "any" or a value of the values-list.
This default value is set as default in the demo gui, and in invocations of prepareDemos.tcl
with an - -attributes option set
